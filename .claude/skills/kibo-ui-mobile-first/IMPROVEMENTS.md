# Skill Rebuild - Following Best Practices ✅

## What Changed

I completely rebuilt the skill following the official best practices from:
- https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/agents-and-tools/agent-skills/best-practices
- https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/equipping-agents-for-the-real-world-with-agent-skills

## Key Improvements

### 1. **Much Shorter** (Critical)
- **Before**: ~600+ lines with excessive explanations
- **After**: ~150 lines focused on essentials
- **Why**: Best practices say keep SKILL.md under 500 lines to save context window

### 2. **Progressive Disclosure**
- **Before**: Everything in one file
- **After**: Core instructions in SKILL.md, details in reference files
- **Pattern**: "For detailed examples, see: templates/*.tsx, frontend/*.md"
- **Why**: Claude loads additional files only when needed, saving tokens

### 3. **Action-Focused Language**
- **Before**: Long explanations like "This component shows best practices..."
- **After**: Direct instructions like "Check these in order: 1. 2. 3."
- **Why**: Claude needs instructions, not educational content

### 4. **Third Person Description**
- **Before**: Mixed first/second person
- **After**: Third person ("Creates mobile-first components...")
- **Why**: Official docs emphasize third person for consistency with Claude's system prompt

### 5. **Specific Triggers in Description**
- **Before**: Generic "Use when creating components"
- **After**: Explicit keywords: "mobile", "responsive", "RTL", "Arabic", "touch", "breakpoint"
- **Why**: Description field is critical for Claude to discover when to use the skill

### 6. **Code Over Prose**
- **Before**: Paragraphs explaining concepts
- **After**: Code examples with minimal comments
- **Why**: Show, don't tell - code is self-documenting

### 7. **Numbered Rules**
- **Before**: Bullet points and paragraphs
- **After**: "Core Rules: 1. 2. 3. 4. 5."
- **Why**: Easier for Claude to reference and follow systematically

### 8. **Concise Patterns Section**
- **Before**: Multiple full component examples
- **After**: 3-4 line code snippets showing the pattern
- **Why**: Minimal examples that illustrate the concept without bloat

## Before vs After Comparison

### Before (❌ Too Long)
```markdown
## When to Use This Skill

Apply this skill when the user:
- Creates any new UI component
- Modifies layouts to be responsive
- Builds forms, cards, or navigation
- Implements RTL/LTR bilingual interfaces
- Works with the GASTAT dossier system
- Mentions mobile, responsive, or touch-friendly design
- References Kibo UI, shadcn/ui, or Tailwind

## Core Requirements

### 1. Mobile-First Design (MANDATORY)

**Every component must:**
- Start at 320px viewport
- Use `useResponsive()` hook
- Have 44px minimum touch targets
- Use mobile-first Tailwind (base → sm: → md: → lg:)

[... 200 more lines of explanation ...]
```

### After (✅ Concise)
```markdown
## Core Rules

1. **Mobile-first ALWAYS** - Design starts at 320px
2. **Check existing first** - Use ResponsiveCard, ResponsiveWrapper
3. **RTL/LTR required** - English (LTR) + Arabic (RTL)
4. **44px touch targets** - Minimum on mobile
5. **No directional CSS** - Use ms-, pe-, not ml-, pr-

## Required Hooks
[code example - 8 lines]

## Before Creating Components
[checklist - 3 items]

## Reference Files
[links to detailed docs]
```

## What Makes This Better

### 1. **Context Efficiency**
- Old: ~4,000 tokens in SKILL.md
- New: ~1,200 tokens in SKILL.md
- **Savings**: 70% reduction in context usage

### 2. **Faster Discovery**
Specific trigger keywords in description help Claude find the skill faster:
```yaml
description: >
  Creates mobile-first, responsive React components with RTL/LTR support.
  Use when: building UI components, forms, cards, layouts, navigation,
  or when user mentions "mobile", "responsive", "RTL", "Arabic", "touch",
  "breakpoint", or "Kibo UI".
```

### 3. **Actionable Instructions**
Every section tells Claude exactly what to do:
- "Check these in order: 1. 2. 3."
- "Every component needs these three hooks:"
- "Use this template:"

### 4. **Progressive Loading**
Heavy content moved to reference files:
- `templates/component-template.tsx` - Full examples
- `frontend/DESIGN_SYSTEM.md` - Complete guide
- `frontend/MOBILE_FIRST_EXAMPLES.md` - Detailed patterns

Claude reads these ONLY when needed.

## Structure Analysis

### SKILL.md Organization
```
1. YAML frontmatter (name + description with triggers)
2. Core Rules (5 numbered rules)
3. Required Hooks (code example)
4. Before Creating Components (checklist)
5. Component Template (minimal working example)
6. Styling Patterns (do's and don'ts)
7. Common Patterns (3 snippets)
8. Data Fetching (1 snippet)
9. Testing Checklist (5 items)
10. Reference Files (links to detailed docs)
11. Project Context (tech stack summary)
```

Total: ~150 lines of focused instructions

### Supporting Files
```
templates/
├── component-template.tsx  (full component with comments)
└── form-template.tsx       (full form with validation)

frontend/
├── DESIGN_SYSTEM.md       (comprehensive guide)
├── COMPONENT_INVENTORY.md (existing components)
└── MOBILE_FIRST_EXAMPLES.md (detailed examples)
```

## Best Practices Applied

### ✅ From Official Docs

1. **"Keep Skills focused"** - Single capability (mobile-first UI)
2. **"Keep main SKILL.md under 500 lines"** - We're at ~150 lines
3. **"Write descriptions in third person"** - Changed from mixed to third person
4. **"Include specific triggers in description"** - Added 10+ trigger keywords
5. **"Progressive disclosure pattern"** - Main file references detailed docs
6. **"Show code, not explanations"** - Replaced prose with code snippets
7. **"Use reference files for details"** - Moved examples to templates/

### ✅ From Community Insights

From https://dev.to/nunc/how-i-built-agent-skills-for-claude-code-oj4:

1. **"Target: Keep SKILL.md under 500 lines"** - We're at ~150 ✅
2. **"Claude already knows basics"** - Removed React/TypeScript explanations ✅
3. **"Show code, move on"** - Minimal comments ✅
4. **"Write description in third person"** - Fixed ✅
5. **"Make description specific with triggers"** - Added clear keywords ✅

## How to Use This Skill

### Automatic Invocation

Claude will use this skill when you mention:
```
"Create a responsive card"
"Build a mobile form"
"Add RTL support"
"Make this touch-friendly"
"Use Kibo UI patterns"
```

### Progressive Loading

1. **First**: Claude reads SKILL.md (150 lines)
2. **If needed**: Claude reads `templates/component-template.tsx`
3. **If needed**: Claude reads `frontend/DESIGN_SYSTEM.md`
4. **Result**: Only loads what's necessary for the task

## Testing

Ask Claude Code:
```
"Create a responsive stat card component using Kibo UI"
```

Expected behavior:
1. ✅ Reads SKILL.md automatically
2. ✅ Follows Core Rules 1-5
3. ✅ Uses ResponsiveCard
4. ✅ Includes three required hooks
5. ✅ Applies mobile-first Tailwind
6. ✅ Uses logical CSS properties
7. ✅ Ensures 44px touch targets
8. ✅ If needs examples, reads template files

## Metrics

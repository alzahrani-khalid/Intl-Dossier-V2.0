# Best Practices Compliance Checklist ✅

This document verifies the skill follows all official best practices from:

- https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/equipping-agents-for-the-real-world-with-agent-skills

## Official Anthropic Best Practices

### Structure & Organization

- [x] **Skill is in proper directory structure** (`.claude/skills/[name]/`)
- [x] **Main file named exactly `SKILL.md`** (not SKILL.txt or skill.md)
- [x] **YAML frontmatter present** with `name` and `description` fields
- [x] **Description field is specific** with clear trigger keywords
- [x] **Skill is focused on single capability** (mobile-first UI development)
- [x] **SKILL.md is under 500 lines** (currently ~150 lines = 70% under limit)

### Progressive Disclosure Pattern

- [x] **Core instructions in SKILL.md** (essentials only)
- [x] **Detailed examples in supporting files** (templates/*.tsx)
- [x] **Reference paths provided** (links to templates/, frontend/*.md)
- [x] **Claude can load additional files as needed** (not all upfront)
- [x] **Context window efficiency maximized** (~1,200 tokens vs ~4,000 before)

### Description Field Quality

- [x] **Third person language** ("Creates..." not "I create...")
- [x] **States what skill does** ("Creates mobile-first components")
- [x] **States when to use it** ("Use when: building UI components...")
- [x] **Includes specific triggers** (mobile, responsive, RTL, Arabic, touch, etc.)
- [x] **Mentions key technologies** (Kibo UI, React, RTL/LTR)

### Content Quality

- [x] **Action-focused instructions** (numbered steps, checklists)
- [x] **Code examples over prose** (show, don't explain)
- [x] **Minimal explanatory text** (no "As you can see..." or "This is important because...")
- [x] **Clear, concise language** (no redundancy or fluff)
- [x] **Concrete patterns** (copy-paste ready code snippets)

### Supporting Files

- [x] **templates/ directory exists** with working code examples
- [x] **README.md present** for developer documentation
- [x] **Files referenced from SKILL.md** ("For details, see...")
- [x] **Code is executable** (templates can be copied directly)

---

## Community Best Practices (from dev.to/nunc)

### File Size

- [x] **SKILL.md under 500 lines** ✅ Currently ~150 lines
- [x] **No encyclopedic explanations** ✅ Removed "what is React" type content
- [x] **Split into reference files when needed** ✅ templates/ for full examples

### Description Quality

- [x] **Written in third person** ✅ "Creates..." not "I can create..."
- [x] **Specific trigger keywords** ✅ "mobile", "responsive", "RTL", "Arabic", etc.
- [x] **Not too vague** ✅ Not "Helps with files" or "Does database stuff"
- [x] **Mentions key concepts user would say** ✅ "touch", "breakpoint", "Kibo UI"

### Content Strategy

- [x] **Show code, move on** ✅ Minimal comments in examples
- [x] **Assume Claude knows basics** ✅ No TypeScript/React tutorials
- [x] **Keep main file as table of contents** ✅ Core rules + references
- [x] **Progressive disclosure for details** ✅ "For examples, see templates/"

---

## Engineering Blog Best Practices

### Progressive Disclosure Architecture

- [x] **Table of contents approach** ✅ Core Rules → Detailed sections
- [x] **Load info only as needed** ✅ Templates loaded separately
- [x] **Unbounded context potential** ✅ Can reference unlimited files
- [x] **Context window starts minimal** ✅ ~150 lines in SKILL.md

### Skill Triggering

- [x] **Metadata included for all skills** ✅ YAML frontmatter with description
- [x] **System prompt triggers skills** ✅ Claude reads description automatically
- [x] **Skills invoked via tool calls** ✅ bash tool reads SKILL.md when triggered
- [x] **Additional files read on demand** ✅ Progressive loading pattern

## Comparison to Official Examples

### Example from Docs: "Generating Commit Messages"

**Their approach**:
```yaml
---
name: Generating Commit Messages
description: Generates clear commit messages from git diffs. 
  Use when writing commit messages or reviewing staged changes.
---

# Instructions
1. Run `git diff --staged`
2. Suggest commit message with:
   - Summary under 50 characters
   - Detailed description

# Best practices
- Use present tense
- Explain what and why, not how
```

**Our approach** (same pattern):
```yaml
---
name: Kibo UI Mobile-First Development
description: Creates mobile-first, responsive React components with RTL/LTR support.
  Use when: building UI components, forms, cards, or when user mentions
  "mobile", "responsive", "RTL", "Arabic", "touch", "breakpoint".
---

# Core Rules
1. Mobile-first ALWAYS
2. Check existing first
3. RTL/LTR required

# Required Hooks
[code example]

# Reference Files
[links to detailed docs]
```

✅ **Pattern matches exactly**: name + description + instructions + optional sections + references

---

## Token Efficiency Analysis

### Before Rebuild
```
SKILL.md: ~4,000 tokens (everything in one file)
+ templates: 0 tokens (didn't exist)
+ docs: 0 tokens (not referenced)
= 4,000 tokens loaded every time
```

### After Rebuild
```
SKILL.md: ~1,200 tokens (core instructions only)
+ templates: ~800 tokens (loaded only if needed)
+ docs: ~2,000 tokens (loaded only if needed)
= 1,200-4,000 tokens (avg ~1,500)
```

**Savings**: ~2,500 tokens per invocation (62% reduction on average)

---

## Specific Best Practices Applied

### 1. Keep Skills Focused ✅
**Rule**: One capability per skill  
**Applied**: Only covers mobile-first UI development (not general React)

### 2. Write Clear Descriptions ✅
**Rule**: State what + when + triggers  
**Applied**: "Creates mobile-first... Use when: ... mentions 'mobile', 'responsive'..."

### 3. Start with Evaluation ✅
**Rule**: Identify gaps in agent capabilities  
**Applied**: Built from real project needs (GASTAT mobile-first requirement)

### 4. Structure for Scale ✅
**Rule**: Split SKILL.md when unwieldy  
**Applied**: Core instructions (150 lines) + reference files (templates/, docs/)

### 5. Progressive Disclosure ✅
**Rule**: Load info only as needed  
**Applied**: SKILL.md references templates/, Claude loads them when needed

### 6. Code as Documentation ✅
**Rule**: Code should be clear about executable vs reference  
**Applied**: Templates marked as examples, patterns shown inline

## Verification Commands

Run these to verify compliance:

```bash
# Check file structure
ls -la .claude/skills/kibo-ui-mobile-first/SKILL.md
# Should exist ✅

# Check YAML frontmatter
head -10 .claude/skills/kibo-ui-mobile-first/SKILL.md
# Should show --- name: ... description: ... --- ✅

# Check file length
wc -l .claude/skills/kibo-ui-mobile-first/SKILL.md
# Should be ~150 lines (under 500) ✅

# Check for third person
grep -i "I create\|you should\|we will" .claude/skills/kibo-ui-mobile-first/SKILL.md
# Should return nothing ✅

# Check for trigger keywords
grep -i "mobile\|responsive\|RTL\|Arabic" .claude/skills/kibo-ui-mobile-first/SKILL.md
# Should find multiple matches ✅
```

# Specification Quality Checklist: Apply Gusto Design System to Mobile App

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-13
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs) - Spec focuses on user needs and behavior, not technical implementation
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs - All requirements tied to user scenarios and measurable outcomes
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders - Language is clear and avoids technical jargon
- [x] All mandatory sections completed - User Scenarios, Mobile Requirements, Requirements, Success Criteria all present

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain - All requirements are fully specified
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous - Each FR has clear acceptance criteria
- [x] Success criteria are measurable - All SC items have specific metrics (time, percentage, count)
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic - SC focuses on user outcomes, not technical implementation
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined - 12 user stories with detailed Given/When/Then scenarios
- [x] Edge cases are identified - 8 edge cases documented with expected behavior
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded - Out of Scope section clearly defines what's excluded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified - 15 assumptions and 5 dependency categories documented

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria - 80 FRs organized by category with specific behaviors
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows - 12 prioritized user stories from P1 (MVP) to P3 (nice-to-have)
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria - 20 SC items aligned with user scenarios
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification - Spec remains technology-agnostic and user-focused

## Validation Results

âœ… **ALL CHECKS PASSED**

The specification is complete, well-structured, and ready for the next phase (`/speckit.plan`).

### Strengths

1. **Comprehensive Route Parity**: Spec documents all 33 web routes (FR-013 through FR-033) ensuring mobile app has equivalent functionality
2. **Gusto Design System Integration**: Clear design requirements (FR-001 through FR-006) based on Gusto Mobile analysis with specific color palette, typography, and component patterns
3. **Prioritized User Stories**: 12 user stories with P1/P2/P3 priorities, each independently testable
4. **Mobile-Specific Requirements**: Offline behavior, native features (biometrics, camera, push notifications), and performance criteria clearly defined
5. **RTL and Accessibility**: Comprehensive requirements for Arabic RTL support (FR-042 through FR-047) and WCAG AA compliance (FR-048 through FR-053)
6. **Detailed Navigation Architecture**: Bottom tab navigation with 5 tabs, stack navigation, modal patterns all specified (FR-007 through FR-012)

### Coverage Analysis

- **User Scenarios**: 12 stories covering all major features from core navigation (P1) to specialized features (P3)
- **Functional Requirements**: 80 FRs organized into 8 categories (Design System, Navigation, Screen Routes, Components, RTL, Accessibility, Performance, Auth, Notifications, Offline)
- **Success Criteria**: 20 measurable outcomes covering performance, usability, accessibility, and user satisfaction
- **Edge Cases**: 8 scenarios documented with expected behavior
- **Key Entities**: 11 entities defined with attributes and relationships

## Notes

- Specification is complete with no outstanding clarifications needed
- Ready to proceed to `/speckit.plan` for implementation planning
- All web routes documented and mapped to mobile navigation structure
- Gusto design patterns fully integrated into requirements

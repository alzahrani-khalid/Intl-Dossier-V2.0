# Requirements Quality Checklist - Waiting Queue Actions

## Specification Quality Assessment

### 1. User Stories - INDEPENDENTLY TESTABLE ✅
- [x] **P1 - Quick Access to Assignment Details**: Can be tested by clicking "View" and verifying modal opens with complete info

- [x] Performance criteria (< 2s page load, < 30s notification delivery)
- [x] Reliability criteria (95% delivery rate, 100% duplicate prevention)
- [x] User experience criteria (touch targets, RTL layout, empty states)
- [x] Load/concurrency criteria (20+ concurrent users)
- [x] Technology-agnostic language

**Assessment**: ✅ All criteria are objectively measurable

### 8. Assumptions - DOCUMENTED ✅
- [x] 10 assumptions listed (A-001 to A-010)
- [x] Cover external dependencies (email addresses, org hierarchy, notification service)
- [x] Infrastructure assumptions (RBAC, Redis, Supabase Realtime)
- [x] Data assumptions (locale preferences, localStorage)

**Assessment**: ✅ Key assumptions clearly stated

### 9. Dependencies - IDENTIFIED ✅
- [x] 7 dependencies listed (D-001 to D-007)
- [x] External services (Notification API, User Management, RBAC)
- [x] Infrastructure (Supabase Database, Realtime, Redis)
- [x] Libraries (i18next)

**Assessment**: ✅ All external dependencies documented

### 10. Constraints - REALISTIC ✅
- [x] 18 constraints listed (C-001 to C-018)
- [x] Technical constraints (bulk limits, rate limits, timeout limits)

**Assessment**: ✅ Comprehensive constraint documentation

### 11. Scope Boundaries - CLEAR ✅
- [x] **In Scope**: 11 items clearly listed (all core functionality)
- [x] **Out of Scope**: 10 items clearly listed (advanced features for future phases)
- [x] No ambiguity about what will/won't be delivered

**Assessment**: ✅ Clear boundaries prevent scope creep

### 12. Mobile-First & RTL Compliance ✅

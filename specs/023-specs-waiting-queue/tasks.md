# Tasks: Waiting Queue Actions

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/023-specs-waiting-queue/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md, research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

**Tests**: Tests are included following TDD approach (spec requires tests for all user stories).

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (US1, US2, US3, US4, US5)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
- **Backend**: `backend/src/`, `backend/tests/`
- **Frontend**: `frontend/src/`, `frontend/tests/`
- **Database**: `supabase/migrations/`, `supabase/functions/`

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - **BLOCKS all user stories**
- **User Stories (Phase 3-7)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories can then proceed in parallel (if team has capacity)
  - Or sequentially in priority order: US1 (P1) ‚Üí US2 (P1) ‚Üí US3 (P2) ‚Üí US4 (P2) ‚Üí US5 (P3)
- **Polish (Phase 8)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - **No dependencies on other stories** ‚úÖ MVP
- **User Story 2 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - **No dependencies on other stories** ‚úÖ MVP
- **User Story 3 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Extends US2 reminder functionality but independently testable
- **User Story 4 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - **No dependencies on other stories**
- **User Story 5 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - **No dependencies on other stories**

### Within Each User Story

- Tests (contract, integration, component, E2E) MUST be written FIRST and FAIL before implementation
- Backend: Models/Types ‚Üí Services ‚Üí Edge Functions ‚Üí Integration
- Frontend: Hooks ‚Üí Components ‚Üí Page Integration
- Story complete before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

**Setup Phase (Phase 1)**:
```bash
# All setup tasks can run in parallel:
Task T001 (backend deps) || Task T002 (frontend deps) || Task T003 (env) || Task T004 (redis)
```

**Foundational Phase (Phase 2)**:
```bash
# All migrations can run in parallel (T005-T009):
Task T005 (reminder cooldown) || Task T006 (hierarchy) || Task T007 (escalations) || Task T008 (reminders audit) || Task T009 (indexes)

# Backend infrastructure can run in parallel (T012-T015):
Task T012 (types) || Task T013 (redis config) || Task T014 (rate limit) || Task T015 (queues)

# Frontend infrastructure can run in parallel (T016-T017):
Task T016 (query client) || Task T017 (i18n keys)
```

**User Story 1 Tests (T018-T019)**:
```bash
# All US1 tests can run in parallel:
Task T018 (component test) || Task T019 (E2E test)
```

**User Story 1 Implementation (T020-T021)**:
```bash
# Models/Components with no dependencies can run in parallel:
Task T020 (AssignmentDetailsModal) || Task T021 (useAssignmentDetails hook)
```

**Across User Stories (After Foundational Phase Complete)**:
```bash
# With 5 developers, all stories can start in parallel:
Dev A: User Story 1 (T018-T024)
Dev B: User Story 2 (T025-T038)
Dev C: User Story 3 (T039-T053)
Dev D: User Story 4 (T054-T070)
Dev E: User Story 5 (T071-T088)
```

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 2 (Reminders)

```bash
# Launch all tests for US2 together (write tests FIRST):
Task T025: "Contract test for /waiting-queue-reminder/send"
Task T026: "Integration test for reminder cooldown"
Task T027: "Integration test for rate limiting"
Task T028: "Component test for ReminderButton"
Task T029: "E2E test for reminder workflow"

# After tests written and failing, launch backend implementation in parallel:
Task T030: "Create reminder service (checkCooldown, sendReminder)"
Task T031: "Create bilingual notification templates (en/ar)"

# Frontend components can also run in parallel:
Task T035: "Create ReminderButton component"
Task T036: "Create useReminderAction hook"
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Stories 1 + 2 Only)

**Rationale**: US1 (view details) + US2 (send reminder) provide core value - users can see assignments and take action

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup (T001-T004)
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (T005-T017) - **CRITICAL - blocks all stories**
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (T018-T024)
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test US1 independently - verify users can view assignment details
5. Complete Phase 4: User Story 2 (T025-T038)
6. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test US1 + US2 together - verify view + remind workflow
7. Deploy/demo MVP (2 user stories complete)

**MVP Scope**: 38 tasks (T001-T038)
**Estimated Effort**: 2-3 weeks with 2 developers

### Incremental Delivery

**After MVP (US1 + US2) is live, add features incrementally**:

1. **Foundation + US1 + US2** ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy (MVP! üéØ)
2. **Add US3 (Bulk Reminders)** ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy
3. **Add US4 (Escalation)** ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy
4. **Add US5 (Filtering)** ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy
5. **Add Polish** ‚Üí Final optimization ‚Üí Deploy

Each increment adds value without breaking previous features.

### Parallel Team Strategy

**With 3 developers after Foundational phase complete**:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together (T001-T017)
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - **Developer A**: User Story 1 + 2 (MVP core - T018-T038)
   - **Developer B**: User Story 3 + 4 (Bulk + Escalation - T039-T070)
   - **Developer C**: User Story 5 (Filtering - T071-T088)
3. Stories complete and integrate independently
4. Team collaborates on Polish (T089-T102)

## Task Summary

- **Total Tasks**: 110
- **Phase 1 (Setup)**: 4 tasks
- **Phase 2 (Foundational)**: 17 tasks (BLOCKS all user stories)
- **Phase 3 (US1 - View Details)**: 7 tasks (5 implementation + 2 tests)
- **Phase 4 (US2 - Reminders)**: 16 tasks (10 implementation + 6 tests)
- **Phase 5 (US3 - Bulk Reminders)**: 15 tasks (10 implementation + 5 tests)
- **Phase 6 (US4 - Escalation)**: 18 tasks (12 implementation + 6 tests)
- **Phase 7 (US5 - Filtering)**: 18 tasks (13 implementation + 5 tests)
- **Phase 8 (Polish)**: 15 tasks

### Parallel Opportunities Identified

- **Setup**: 4 tasks can run in parallel
- **Foundational**: 13 tasks can run in parallel (after migrations applied sequentially)
- **Per User Story**: 2-5 tests can run in parallel, 2-4 implementation tasks can run in parallel
- **Across User Stories**: All 5 stories can run in parallel after Foundational phase complete

### Independent Test Criteria by Story

- **US1**: Click View ‚Üí modal opens with all assignment details
- **US2**: Send reminder ‚Üí notification delivered, cooldown prevents duplicate
- **US3**: Select 5 items ‚Üí send bulk ‚Üí all 5 notifications sent with progress tracking
- **US4**: Escalate assignment ‚Üí escalation record created, manager notified
- **US5**: Apply 2 filters ‚Üí only matching results shown, clear filters ‚Üí all results return

### Suggested MVP Scope

**User Stories 1 + 2** (View Details + Individual Reminders)
- **Total Tasks**: 39 (T001-T038, including T034a)
- **Value Delivered**: Users can view waiting assignments and send follow-up reminders with reliable retry mechanism - core workflow complete
- **Estimated Timeline**: 2-3 weeks with 2 developers
- **Success Criteria**: Users can independently view assignment details and send reminders with cooldown enforcement and notification delivery reliability

## Notes

- **[P] tasks** = different files, no dependencies - can run in parallel
- **[Story] label** maps task to specific user story for traceability
- **Each user story is independently completable and testable** - can deploy individually
- **TDD workflow**: Write tests FIRST ‚Üí ensure they FAIL ‚Üí implement ‚Üí tests PASS
- **Commit** after each task or logical group (e.g., all US1 tests, all US1 components)
- **Stop at any checkpoint** to validate story independently before proceeding
- **Avoid**: vague tasks, same file conflicts, cross-story dependencies that break independence
- **File paths are absolute** - adjust if project structure changes
- **Environment variables must be configured** (T003) before backend services can run
- **Database migrations must complete** (T005-T011) before any user story implementation

# Implementation Plan: Waiting Queue Actions

**Branch**: `023-specs-waiting-queue` | **Date**: 2025-01-14 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/023-specs-waiting-queue/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

Implement comprehensive action management for the waiting queue system, enabling users to view assignment details, send follow-up reminders (individual and bulk), escalate overdue items to management, and apply advanced filtering/sorting. The system will support bilingual notifications (English/Arabic), mobile-first responsive UI with full RTL support, rate limiting to prevent spam, and real-time updates when assignments change status.

**Technical Approach**: Extend existing waiting queue infrastructure with:
- Backend API endpoints for reminders, escalations, and filtering using Supabase Edge Functions
- Frontend components for action buttons, bulk selection, and filter UI using React 19 + TanStack Query
- Database schema additions for escalation records and follow-up audit trails with RLS policies
- Notification service integration for email and in-app delivery via existing notification infrastructure
- Redis-based rate limiting and queue management for bulk operations
- Real-time updates via Supabase Realtime subscriptions

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: TypeScript 5.8+ (strict mode), Node.js 18+ LTS (backend), React 19 (frontend)
**Primary Dependencies**: React 19, TanStack Router v5, TanStack Query v5, Supabase (PostgreSQL 15+, Auth, Realtime), Redis 7.x, i18next, shadcn/ui, Tailwind CSS
**Architecture Decision**: Supabase Edge Functions contain all business logic (self-contained). Backend services (backend/src/services/) are NOT used by Edge Functions. Edge Functions are Deno-based and self-sufficient. Backend services exist only if shared across multiple Edge Functions or used by non-Edge-Function backends.
**Storage**: PostgreSQL 15+ (Supabase) with pgvector, pg_trgm extensions; Redis 7.x for rate limiting and queues
**Testing**: Vitest (unit/integration), Playwright (E2E), contract tests for new endpoints
**Target Platform**: Web (cross-platform: desktop 1024px+, tablet 768px+, mobile 375px+), Arabic RTL + English LTR
**Project Type**: Web application (backend + frontend)
**Performance Goals**:
- Assignment detail view: <2s p95 load time
- Follow-up reminders: <30s delivery (95th percentile)
- Bulk operations (50 items): <60s completion
- Filter/sort updates: <1s response time
- API endpoints: <200ms p95 latency
**Constraints**:
- Bulk actions limited to 100 items max
- Rate limiting: 100 notifications per 5-minute window per user
- Follow-up reminder cooldown: 24 hours (configurable)
- Touch targets: min 44x44px (WCAG 2.1)
- RTL support: logical properties only (no ml-*, mr-*, pl-*, pr-*)
**Scale/Scope**:
- Expected load: 500+ concurrent users, 10,000+ assignments in queue
- Notification volume: up to 1,000 reminders/day
- Database: indexed queries on assigned_at, status, workflow_stage
- Scope: 5 user stories, 36 functional requirements, 17 success criteria

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

### Principle I: Mobile-First & Responsive Design ✅ PASS

**Requirement**: Every UI component MUST be built mobile-first with progressive enhancement.

**Compliance**:
- Spec explicitly requires mobile-first responsive UI (FR-033)
- Touch targets specified at minimum 44x44px (FR-035)
- Breakpoints follow Tailwind progressive enhancement (base → sm → md → lg → xl)
- User Story 1 (Scenario 3) validates mobile 375px viewport with touch-friendly controls
- User Story 5 confirms mobile filter panel as bottom sheet with touch-friendly controls

**Status**: ✅ Compliant - Feature spec mandates mobile-first design patterns

---

### Principle II: RTL/LTR Internationalization ✅ PASS

**Requirement**: All UI components MUST support bidirectional text using logical properties exclusively.

**Compliance**:
- Spec explicitly requires full RTL layout support (FR-034)
- Logical properties mandated (ms-*, me-*, ps-*, pe-*) - no ml-*, mr-*, pl-*, pr-*
- Bilingual notifications (English/Arabic) with proper RTL formatting (FR-021)
- User Story 2 (Scenario 4) validates Arabic locale rendering with RTL formatting
- User Story 1 (Scenario 3) confirms RTL support for Arabic in mobile view

**Status**: ✅ Compliant - RTL support is core requirement with logical properties enforced

---

### Principle III: Test-First Development ✅ PASS

**Requirement**: Tests MUST be written FIRST and verified to FAIL before implementation begins.

**Compliance**:
- All 5 user stories have explicit acceptance scenarios (independently testable)
- Spec declares user stories are "independently testable" for TDD workflow
- Success criteria include measurable outcomes (SC-001 through SC-017)
- Edge cases documented for test coverage
- Testing strategy specified: Vitest (unit/integration), Playwright (E2E), contract tests

**Action Required**: Generate test files BEFORE implementation during Phase 2 (/speckit.tasks execution)

**Status**: ✅ Compliant - Spec supports TDD workflow with testable acceptance criteria

---

### Principle IV: Type Safety & Strict Mode ✅ PASS

**Requirement**: TypeScript strict mode MUST be enabled. No `any` type usage.

**Compliance**:
- TypeScript 5.8+ strict mode specified in Technical Context
- Key entities fully typed: Assignment, EscalationRecord, FollowUpReminder, SelectionState, FilterCriteria
- Entity attributes explicitly defined with types (id, work_item_id, assignee_id, etc.)
- Null safety required for assignee_id validation (FR-006)

**Status**: ✅ Compliant - Strict TypeScript enforced with explicit entity typing

---

### Principle V: Security & Privacy by Default ✅ PASS

**Requirement**: RLS MUST be enabled on all tables. Authentication via Supabase Auth.

**Compliance**:
- Assignment details view requires Read permission enforced by RLS (C-006)
- Escalation action requires Escalate permission enforced by backend validation (C-007)
- Authentication assumed via existing Supabase Auth (A-005 - RBAC system)
- Audit trail required for all reminders and escalations (FR-014, SC-014)
- User permissions enforced (edge case: user with no permission cannot escalate)

**Action Required**: Ensure RLS policies created during database migration (Phase 1)

**Status**: ✅ Compliant - Security enforced via RLS and RBAC

---

### Principle VI: Performance & Scalability ✅ PASS

**Requirement**: Database queries MUST use indexes. API responses <200ms p95 latency.

**Compliance**:
- Performance goals specified: API <200ms p95, filters <1s, bulk 50 items <60s
- Database indexes required on assigned_at, status, workflow_stage (C-017)
- Redis caching for rate limiting counters and queued notifications (D-006)
- Bulk actions limited to 100 items to prevent system overload (FR-012, C-001)
- Rate limiting enforced: 100 notifications per 5-min window (FR-022, C-003)
- Scalability targets: 500+ concurrent users, 10,000+ assignments, 1,000 reminders/day

**Action Required**: Create database indexes during migration (Phase 1)

**Status**: ✅ Compliant - Performance targets and scalability constraints defined

---

### Principle VII: Accessibility (WCAG AA Compliance) ✅ PASS

**Requirement**: All UI components MUST meet WCAG AA standards.

**Compliance**:
- Touch targets: minimum 44x44px (FR-035, C-010) per WCAG 2.1
- Visual feedback for all actions: loading spinners, success/error toasts, confirmation dialogs (FR-032)
- Empty states with clear guidance (FR-036, SC-010)
- Color-coded aging indicators (FR-031) - must ensure sufficient contrast ratios
- Keyboard accessibility implied by shadcn/ui component usage (accessible by default)

**Action Required**: Verify color contrast ratios meet 4.5:1 minimum during design (Phase 1)

**Status**: ✅ Compliant - Accessibility standards incorporated in requirements

---

### Principle VIII: Cross-Platform Mobile Development ⚠️ PARTIAL

**Requirement**: All features MUST explicitly declare platform scope (web-only, mobile-only, cross-platform).

**Compliance**:
- Feature spec does NOT explicitly declare platform scope
- Technical Context specifies "Web application" target platform
- No mobile-specific requirements (offline-first, WatermelonDB, React Native Paper)
- User scenarios focus on web UI patterns (modals, bottom sheets, checkboxes)

**Platform Scope Decision**: **Web-only** (desktop + tablet + mobile web)

**Justification**: Waiting queue action management is primarily a desktop workflow for managers and staff. Mobile web support is provided via responsive design, but native mobile app implementation is out of scope for this feature.

**Status**: ⚠️ PARTIAL - Platform scope inferred as web-only, should be explicitly stated in spec

---

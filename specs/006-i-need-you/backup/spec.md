## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As a user of the GASTAT International Dossier System, I want to switch between different visual themes (GASTAT and Blue Sky), toggle between light and dark modes, and change the interface language between English and Arabic, so that I can work in my preferred visual environment and language.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a new user accessing the system, **When** they first load the application, **Then** the GASTAT theme in light mode with English language is displayed by default
2. **Given** a user viewing the application, **When** they select dark mode, **Then** all interface elements immediately update to use dark color schemes while maintaining readability
3. **Given** a user in English interface, **When** they switch to Arabic, **Then** the interface direction changes to RTL and all text is displayed in Arabic
4. **Given** a user has selected Blue Sky theme in dark mode with Arabic language, **When** they refresh the page, **Then** their preferences persist and are restored
5. **Given** a user switches from GASTAT theme to Blue Sky theme, **When** the change is applied, **Then** all color schemes, fonts, and visual elements update to reflect the Blue Sky design

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a user's browser doesn't support localStorage for preference persistence?
- How does the system handle theme switching while modal dialogs or popups are open?
- What happens if a user switches language in the middle of filling out a form?
- How does the system handle theme/language switching on slower connections or devices?

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide a theme selector allowing users to choose between GASTAT and Blue Sky themes
- **FR-002**: System MUST support dark and light mode toggles for each theme
- **FR-003**: System MUST support language switching between English and Arabic
- **FR-004**: System MUST display interface in right-to-left (RTL) layout when Arabic is selected
- **FR-005**: System MUST persist user's theme, mode, and language preferences across sessions
- **FR-006**: System MUST apply GASTAT theme in light mode with English as the default for new users
- **FR-007**: Theme switcher MUST be easily accessible from the main interface at all times
- **FR-008**: System MUST update all visual elements immediately when theme/mode/language changes without requiring page reload
- **FR-009**: System MUST maintain text readability and contrast ratios in all theme/mode combinations
- **FR-010**: All UI text elements MUST have translations available in both English and Arabic
- **FR-011**: System MUST handle font changes appropriately for each theme (Plus Jakarta Sans for GASTAT, Open Sans for Blue Sky)
- **FR-012**: System MUST respect user's system-level dark mode preference on first visit if no preference is stored

### Key Entities
- **Theme Configuration**: Represents a complete visual theme (GASTAT or Blue Sky) with associated color palettes, typography, spacing, and shadow definitions for both light and dark modes
- **Language Setting**: Represents the selected interface language (English or Arabic) with associated text direction (LTR or RTL) and translation mappings
- **User Preference**: Stores the user's selected theme name, color mode (light/dark), and language choice for persistence across sessions

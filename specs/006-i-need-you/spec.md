## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As a user of the GASTAT International Dossier System, I want to switch between different visual themes (GASTAT and Blue Sky), toggle between light and dark modes, and change the interface language between English and Arabic, so that I can work in my preferred visual environment and language.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a new user accessing the system, **When** they first load the application, **Then** the GASTAT theme in light mode with English language is displayed by default
2. **Given** a user viewing the application, **When** they select dark mode, **Then** all interface elements immediately update to use dark color schemes while maintaining readability
3. **Given** a user in English interface, **When** they switch to Arabic, **Then** the interface direction changes to RTL and all text is displayed in Arabic
4. **Given** a user has selected Blue Sky theme in dark mode with Arabic language, **When** they refresh the page, **Then** their preferences persist and are restored
5. **Given** a user switches from GASTAT theme to Blue Sky theme, **When** the change is applied, **Then** all color schemes, fonts, and visual elements update to reflect the Blue Sky design

### Edge Cases
- When localStorage is unavailable, the system falls back to sessionStorage, then to in-memory storage for the current session
- When cookies are disabled, the system uses in-memory storage with a warning notification to the user
- When theme switching occurs with open modals/popups, these elements update immediately without closing
- When language switches during form completion, form data is preserved and labels update without data loss
- On slow connections, a loading indicator appears during theme asset loading with a 3-second timeout fallback
- When network fails during preference sync, local changes are queued and retried when connection is restored
- When system preferences conflict with stored preferences, the precedence order is: Stored ‚Üí System ‚Üí Application defaults

## Requirements

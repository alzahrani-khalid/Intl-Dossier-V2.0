# Specification Quality Checklist: Intake Entity Linking System

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-01-18
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

### Content Quality: ✅ PASS
- Specification is written in business language focusing on user value
- No technology-specific implementation details (databases, frameworks, APIs) in requirements
- All mandatory sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria) are complete
- Language is accessible to non-technical stakeholders

### Requirement Completeness: ✅ PASS
- All 18 functional requirements are testable and unambiguous
- No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers present - all requirements have clear definitions
- 10 success criteria are measurable with specific metrics (time, percentage, count)
- Success criteria are technology-agnostic (e.g., "Triage officers can link... in under 30 seconds" vs "API response time")
- Each of 5 user stories has 3-4 acceptance scenarios in Given-When-Then format
- 8 edge cases identified covering security, concurrency, and error handling
- Scope is clearly bounded with 10 items explicitly listed as "Out of Scope"
- 10 assumptions and 8 dependencies documented

### Feature Readiness: ✅ PASS
- All functional requirements map to acceptance scenarios in user stories
- User scenarios cover complete workflow from triage → AI suggestions → conversion → discovery → management
- Success criteria align with user stories (e.g., SC-001 supports User Story 1, SC-002 supports User Story 2)
- No implementation leakage - specification maintains abstraction from technical details

## Notes

✅ **Specification is ready for `/speckit.plan` or `/speckit.clarify`**

All checklist items passed validation. The specification is:
- Complete and testable
- Free of implementation details
- Measurable with clear success criteria
- Properly scoped with dependencies and assumptions documented
- Ready to proceed to planning phase

No issues found requiring spec updates.

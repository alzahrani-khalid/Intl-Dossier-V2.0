# Tasks: Intake Entity Linking System

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/024-intake-entity-linking/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md ‚úÖ, spec.md ‚úÖ, research.md ‚úÖ, data-model.md ‚úÖ, contracts/ ‚úÖ, quickstart.md ‚úÖ

**Feature Summary**: Polymorphic entity linking system allowing triage officers to associate intake tickets with 11 entity types using 5 link types. Includes AI-powered suggestions via AnythingLLM with pgvector semantic search, soft-delete for audit trails, and automatic link migration when intake tickets convert to formal positions.

**Tests**: This feature follows Test-First Development (Principle III). Contract and integration tests are written before implementation to ensure quality.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `- [ ] [ID] [P?] [Story] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (US1-US5)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Story 1 (Phase 3)**: Depends on Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (Phase 4)**: Depends on Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 3 (Phase 5)**: Depends on Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 4 (Phase 6)**: Depends on Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 5 (Phase 7)**: Depends on Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **Polish (Phase 8)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

All user stories are designed to be independently implementable after Phase 2 completion:

- **User Story 1 (P1) üéØ MVP**: Manual linking - Foundation for all linking operations
- **User Story 2 (P1)**: AI suggestions - Extends US1 with AI, but US1 works without it
- **User Story 3 (P2)**: Migration - Uses link creation from US1, but US1 works without migration
- **User Story 4 (P2)**: Reverse lookup - Independent query capability
- **User Story 5 (P3)**: Link management - Extends US1 with CRUD, but US1 works with create-only

### Within Each User Story

- **Tests FIRST**: Contract and integration tests must be written before implementation
- **Tests must FAIL**: Verify tests fail before writing implementation (red-green-refactor)
- **Backend before Frontend**: Backend services and APIs before frontend components
- **Hooks before Components**: TanStack Query hooks before React components
- **Core before Integration**: Complete core functionality before integration points

### Parallel Opportunities

**Phase 1 (Setup)**: T002, T003, T004, T005, T006, T007 can run in parallel

**Phase 2 (Foundational Backend)**: T019, T020, T021, T022, T023, T024 can run in parallel

**Phase 2 (Foundational Frontend)**: T025, T026, T027 can run in parallel

**User Story 1 Contract Tests**: T028, T029, T030, T031, T032 can run in parallel

**User Story 1 Backend Services**: T033, T034, T035 can run in parallel

**User Story 1 Frontend Hooks**: T043, T044 can run in parallel

**User Story 1 Frontend Components**: T045, T046 can run in parallel

**User Story 2 Contract Tests**: T055, T056, T057, T058 can run in parallel

**User Story 2 Backend AI Services**: T059, T060 can run in parallel

**User Story 3 Contract Tests**: T078, T079, T080, T081 can run in parallel

**User Story 3 Backend Services**: T082 can run in parallel with other US3 tasks (no dependencies)

**User Story 4 Contract Tests**: T090, T091 can run in parallel

**User Story 4 Backend Services**: T092 can run in parallel with frontend tasks

**User Story 4 Frontend Components**: T097 can start while backend is being developed

**User Story 5 Contract Tests**: T102, T103, T104, T105 can run in parallel

**User Story 5 Backend Services**: T106, T107, T108, T109 can run in parallel

**User Story 5 Frontend Hooks**: T115 can run in parallel with backend development

**Phase 8 (Polish)**: Most tasks marked [P] can run in parallel

**Multiple User Stories**: After Phase 2 is complete, different team members can work on different user stories in parallel (US1, US2, US3, US4, US5 all independent)

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1

```bash
# Step 1: Launch all contract tests in parallel (must FAIL before implementation)
Task T028: Contract test for POST /api/intake/{intake_id}/links
Task T029: Contract test for GET /api/intake/{intake_id}/links
Task T030: Contract test for GET /api/entities/search
Task T031: Integration test for clearance enforcement
Task T032: Integration test for entity search ranking

# Step 2: Verify tests fail, then launch backend services in parallel
Task T033: Implement createEntityLink() in link.service.ts
Task T034: Implement getEntityLinks() in link.service.ts
Task T035: Implement searchEntities() in entity-search.service.ts

# Step 3: Launch frontend hooks in parallel
Task T043: Create use-entity-links.ts hook
Task T044: Create use-entity-search.ts hook

# Step 4: Launch frontend components in parallel
Task T045: Create LinkTypeBadge.tsx
Task T046: Create LinkCard.tsx
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only) üéØ

1. ‚úÖ Complete Phase 1: Setup (T001-T007)
2. ‚úÖ Complete Phase 2: Foundational (T008-T027) - CRITICAL BLOCKER
3. ‚úÖ Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (T028-T054)
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test User Story 1 independently per quickstart.md
5. Deploy to staging for QA validation
6. **MVP Complete!** - Triage officers can manually link intake tickets to entities

### Incremental Delivery

1. **Foundation** (Phases 1-2): Setup + Foundational ‚Üí Database and infrastructure ready
2. **MVP Release** (Phase 3): User Story 1 ‚Üí Manual linking functional ‚Üí Deploy/Demo üéØ
3. **AI Release** (Phase 4): User Story 2 ‚Üí AI suggestions added ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
4. **Migration Release** (Phase 5): User Story 3 ‚Üí Intake conversion supported ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
5. **Discovery Release** (Phase 6): User Story 4 ‚Üí Reverse lookup added ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
6. **Management Release** (Phase 7): User Story 5 ‚Üí Full CRUD lifecycle ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
7. **Production Release** (Phase 8): Polish ‚Üí Production-ready deployment

Each release adds value without breaking previous functionality!

### Parallel Team Strategy (3+ Developers)

**Week 1**: Entire team completes Setup (Phase 1) + Foundational (Phase 2) together

**Week 2-3** (After Foundational is done):
- **Developer A**: User Story 1 (T028-T054) - MVP priority
- **Developer B**: User Story 2 (T055-T077) - AI suggestions
- **Developer C**: User Story 3 (T078-T089) - Migration

**Week 4** (Continue parallel development):

## Notes

- **[P] marker**: Tasks can run in parallel because they work on different files with no dependencies
- **[Story] label**: Maps task to specific user story (US1-US5) for traceability and independent testing
- **Test-First Development**: All tests (T028-T032, T055-T058, T078-T081, T090-T091, T102-T105) must be written BEFORE implementation and verified to FAIL
- **Independent User Stories**: Each story should be fully functional and testable on its own after Phase 2
- **Mobile-First Required**: All frontend components must start with base styles (320px) and scale up with breakpoints
- **RTL Arabic Required**: All frontend components must use logical properties (ms-*, me-*, ps-*, pe-*) and detect RTL direction
- **Commit Strategy**: Commit after each task or logical group for easy rollback
- **Checkpoint Validation**: Stop at each checkpoint to test the user story independently before proceeding
- **Performance Targets**: Verify targets met at T126 before production deployment

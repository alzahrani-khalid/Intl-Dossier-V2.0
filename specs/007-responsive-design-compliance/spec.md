# Feature Specification: Responsive Design Compliance and Assurance

**Feature Branch**: `007-responsive-design-compliance`
**Created**: 2025-09-29
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "responsive design compliance and assurance .. shadcn components from registries in components.json .. assuring design language and style .. ultrathink"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Extract: responsive design, shadcn components, design language, ultrathink style
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: design system compliance, component registry, responsive breakpoints, style consistency
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí Define responsive design validation scenarios
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Focus on design consistency and responsiveness
6. Identify Key Entities (design tokens, breakpoints, component registry)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí Check for implementation independence
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-09-29
- Q: What specific breakpoint values should the system enforce for responsive design? ‚Üí A: 320px, 768px, 1024px, 1440px (Mobile-first with 4 breakpoints)
- Q: What typography scale should be used for the ultra-thin design hierarchy? ‚Üí A: 12/14/16/20/24/32px (Compact scale with small increments)
- Q: How should content be prioritized when switching from desktop to mobile viewports? ‚Üí A: Progressive disclosure with expand/collapse for secondary content
- Q: What is the maximum acceptable time for design compliance checks to complete? ‚Üí A: 500ms for full page validation
- Q: Which browsers and versions should the responsive design system support? ‚Üí A: Latest 2 versions of Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As a user of the International Dossier System, I need a consistent and responsive interface that adapts seamlessly to any device (mobile, tablet, desktop) while maintaining visual clarity and usability through an ultra-thin, modern design language.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user accesses the application on a mobile device (320px-768px), **When** they navigate through different pages, **Then** all content should be properly displayed without horizontal scrolling and with appropriate touch targets (minimum 44x44px)

2. **Given** a user views the application on a tablet (768px-1024px), **When** they interact with components, **Then** the layout should optimize for the available space while maintaining readability and component proportions

3. **Given** a user uses the application on a desktop (1024px+), **When** they resize the browser window, **Then** the interface should smoothly adapt breakpoints without content jumping or layout breaking

4. **Given** any registered shadcn component is used, **When** it renders on any screen size, **Then** it should maintain consistent styling, spacing, and behavior as defined in the design system

5. **Given** a developer adds a new UI component, **When** they reference the component registry, **Then** they should only use approved shadcn components that comply with the ultra-thin design language

### Edge Cases
- What happens when content exceeds viewport boundaries on small screens?
- How does system handle orientation changes on mobile devices?
- What is the fallback behavior for unsupported browser viewport units?
- How are complex data tables handled on mobile viewports?

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST enforce responsive breakpoints at 320px, 768px, 1024px, and 1440px
- **FR-002**: System MUST utilize only shadcn components registered in the components.json registry
- **FR-003**: All UI elements MUST maintain minimum touch target sizes of 44x44 pixels on touch devices
- **FR-004**: System MUST ensure text remains readable without horizontal scrolling at all viewport widths down to 320px
- **FR-005**: System MUST apply consistent spacing scale across all components (ultra-thin design principle)
- **FR-006**: All components MUST maintain visual hierarchy through typography scale: 12px, 14px, 16px, 20px, 24px, 32px
- **FR-007**: System MUST validate component usage against the approved registry before rendering
- **FR-008**: Design system MUST provide consistent color tokens that work across all viewport sizes and device types
- **FR-009**: System MUST ensure all interactive elements are accessible via keyboard navigation at all breakpoints
- **FR-010**: Components MUST maintain aspect ratios for media content across different screen sizes
- **FR-011**: System MUST provide visual feedback for all interactive states (hover, focus, active, disabled) consistently across components
- **FR-012**: Layout MUST implement progressive disclosure with expand/collapse controls for secondary content on mobile viewports

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **NFR-001**: Design compliance checks MUST complete within 500ms for full page validation
- **NFR-002**: Component registry MUST be versioned to ensure design consistency across deployments
- **NFR-003**: Design system documentation MUST be accessible to all team members
- **NFR-004**: System MUST support the latest 2 versions of Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge browsers

### Key Entities
- **Component Registry**: Central source of truth for approved shadcn components, their variants, and usage guidelines
- **Design Tokens**: Standardized values for colors, typography, spacing, borders, and shadows that ensure visual consistency
- **Breakpoint System**: Defined viewport ranges that trigger responsive layout changes
- **Validation Rules**: Set of checks to ensure components comply with responsive design and ultra-thin aesthetic requirements
- **Style Guidelines**: Documentation of the ultra-thin design language principles and their application

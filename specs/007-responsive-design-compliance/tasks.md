# Tasks: Responsive Design Compliance and Assurance

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/007-responsive-design-compliance/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/api-spec.yaml

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Load plan.md from feature directory
   → Extract: TypeScript 5.0+, React 18+, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui
   → Structure: Web app (frontend + backend)
2. Load design documents:
   → data-model.md: 10 entities → TypeScript interfaces
   → contracts/api-spec.yaml: 9 endpoints → contract tests
   → quickstart.md: 7 setup scenarios → integration tests
3. Generate tasks by category:
   → Setup: Tailwind config, design tokens, shadcn registry
   → Tests: API contract tests, responsive tests
   → Core: Hooks, providers, components
   → Integration: API endpoints, validation
   → Polish: E2E tests, accessibility, performance
4. Apply task rules:
   → Different files = mark [P] for parallel
   → Same file = sequential (no [P])
   → Tests before implementation (TDD)
5. Number tasks sequentially (T001-T038)
6. Return: SUCCESS (38 tasks ready for execution)
```

## Format: `[ID] [P?] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
- **Backend**: `backend/src/`, `backend/tests/`
- **Frontend**: `frontend/src/`, `frontend/tests/`
- **Shared**: Types in `frontend/src/types/`, backend mirrors structure

## Dependencies

### Critical Path
1. **Setup (T001-T006)** → Everything else depends on configuration
2. **TypeScript Interfaces (T007-T014)** → Required by hooks and API
3. **Contract Tests (T015-T022)** → Must fail before API implementation
4. **Hooks (T023-T027)** → Required by components and providers
5. **API Implementation (T029-T034)** → Makes contract tests pass
6. **Components (T035-T038)** → Depends on hooks and providers
7. **Integration Tests (T039-T043)** → Validates full stack
8. **Polish (T044-T048)** → Final quality assurance

### Specific Dependencies
- T001 blocks T023 (breakpoints needed by useResponsive)
- T002 blocks T027 (tokens needed by useDesignTokens)
- T023 blocks T025 (useResponsive needed by provider)
- T025 blocks T035-T038 (provider wraps components)
- T015-T022 must fail before T029-T034
- All implementation before T044-T048 (polish)

- **Commit frequency**: After each completed task

## Validation Checklist
*Verified during task generation*

- [x] All 9 API endpoints have contract tests
- [x] All 10 entities have TypeScript interfaces
- [x] All tests come before implementation

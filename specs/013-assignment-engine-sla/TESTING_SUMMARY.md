## Test Coverage Summary

### ✅ Phase 3.2: Contract Tests (API Endpoints)

All 7 contract tests are implemented and validate API endpoint contracts:

- **T024**: POST /assignments/auto-assign - Validates weighted scoring and WIP enforcement
- **T025**: POST /assignments/manual-override - Validates supervisor permissions and override logic
- **T026**: GET /assignments/queue - Validates pagination and permission-based filtering
- **T027**: GET /assignments/my-assignments - Validates SLA countdown calculation
- **T028**: POST /assignments/{id}/escalate - Validates escalation event creation
- **T029**: GET /capacity/check - Validates individual and unit capacity checks
- **T030**: PUT /staff/availability - Validates leave-based reassignment logic

**Location**: `backend/tests/contract/`

---

### ✅ Phase 3.2: Integration Tests (User Scenarios)

All 6 integration tests implement scenarios from quickstart.md:

- **T031**: Skill-based auto-assignment (AS-1) - Validates weighted scoring algorithm
- **T032**: WIP limit enforcement (AS-2) - Validates individual and unit WIP limits
- **T033**: SLA escalation workflow (AS-3) - Validates warning and breach notifications
- **T034**: Priority-based assignment (AS-4) - Validates queue priority ordering
- **T035**: Queue processing on capacity change (AS-5) - Validates trigger-based processing
- **T036**: Leave-based reassignment (AS-6) - Validates urgent/high reassignment logic

**Location**: `backend/tests/integration/`

---

### ✅ Phase 3.2: E2E Tests (Frontend Workflows)

All 3 E2E tests validate complete user workflows using Playwright:

- **T037**: SLA countdown display
  - Real-time countdown updates (client-side calculation)
  - Status indicators (green/yellow/red based on SLA elapsed)
  - Supabase Realtime subscription for server-pushed updates
  - Graceful degradation when WebSocket disconnects
  - ARIA live regions for accessibility

- **T038**: Assignment queue management
  - Supervisor-only access (permission enforcement)
  - Queue sorting (priority DESC, created_at ASC)
  - Filters (priority, work_item_type, unit_id)
  - Real-time updates via Supabase Realtime
  - Pagination controls

- **T039**: Manual assignment override
  - Supervisor can override auto-assignment
  - Override reason validation (min 10 characters)
  - Audit trail creation with timestamp and reason
  - WIP limit bypass with warning
  - Unit boundary enforcement (supervisor can only assign within unit)

**Location**: `frontend/tests/e2e/`

---

### ✅ Phase 3.5: Unit Tests

All 3 unit tests validate core algorithms:

- **T073**: Weighted scoring algorithm - Tests skill/capacity/availability/unit scoring
- **T074**: SLA calculation - Tests deadline calculation for all work_item_type × priority combinations
- **T075**: Queue processing logic - Tests priority ordering and FIFO within priority

**Location**: `backend/tests/unit/`

---

### ✅ Phase 3.5: Performance Tests

All 2 performance tests validate scalability:

- **T080**: Auto-assignment latency
  - Load test with k6 framework
  - Target: p95 < 500ms with 50 concurrent requests
  - Dataset: 500 staff, 200 skills, 1,000 queued items

- **T081**: SLA monitoring throughput
  - Validates sla_check_and_escalate() function
  - Target: <5 seconds for 10,000 active assignments
  - Includes EXPLAIN ANALYZE for query performance

**Location**: `backend/tests/performance/`

### Scenario 4: Priority-Based Assignment ✅
**Automated by**: T034 (integration), T038 (E2E - queue sorting)

### Scenario 5: Queue Processing on Capacity Change ✅
**Automated by**: T035 (integration), T038 (E2E - real-time updates)

### Scenario 6: Leave-Based Reassignment ✅
**Automated by**: T036 (integration)

## Additional Manual Testing Checklist

While most scenarios are automated, the following should be verified manually in a staging environment:

### 1. Performance Validation
- [ ] Run T080 performance test: Verify p95 latency < 500ms
- [ ] Run T081 performance test: Verify SLA monitoring < 5 seconds for 10,000 assignments
- [ ] Monitor pg_cron job execution: Verify sla_check_and_escalate() runs every 30 seconds

### 2. Accessibility Validation
- [ ] Keyboard navigation: Tab through "My Assignments" page, verify all interactive elements accessible
- [ ] Screen reader (NVDA/JAWS): Verify SLA countdown announces time remaining
- [ ] RTL support: Switch to Arabic, verify queue table and countdown direction correct
- [ ] ARIA live regions: Verify countdown updates announced without interrupting user

### 3. Real-time Validation
- [ ] Open "My Assignments" in two browser tabs (same user)
- [ ] Complete assignment in one tab, verify it updates in other tab via Realtime
- [ ] Open "Assignment Queue" as supervisor, verify queue count updates when items assigned
- [ ] Disconnect network temporarily, verify countdown continues (client-side calculation)

### 4. Cross-Browser Testing
- [ ] Chrome: Verify all E2E tests pass
- [ ] Firefox: Verify all E2E tests pass
- [ ] Safari: Verify all E2E tests pass (macOS/iOS)
- [ ] Edge: Verify all E2E tests pass (Windows)

### 5. Bilingual Testing
- [ ] Switch language to Arabic, verify all assignment UI labels translated
- [ ] Verify priority labels (urgent, high, normal, low) display in Arabic
- [ ] Verify SLA status labels (ok, warning, breached) display in Arabic
- [ ] Verify date/time formatting uses Arabic numerals (if configured)

## Test Data Cleanup

After running tests, clean up test data:

```sql
-- Delete test assignments
DELETE FROM assignments WHERE work_item_id LIKE 'test-%' OR work_item_id LIKE 'queue-%';

-- Delete test queue entries
DELETE FROM assignment_queue WHERE work_item_id LIKE 'test-%';

-- Delete test work items
DELETE FROM dossiers WHERE id LIKE 'test-%';
DELETE FROM tickets WHERE id LIKE 'test-%';

-- Reset staff availability
UPDATE staff_profiles SET availability_status = 'available', current_assignment_count = 0
WHERE id LIKE 'test-%';
```

## Known Issues and Limitations

### 1. Performance Test Environment
- Performance tests (T080, T081) require production-like infrastructure
- Local development environment may not meet <500ms p95 target
- Recommended: Run on staging with realistic data volume

### 2. Supabase Realtime Delays
- Realtime updates may have 1-3 second latency in development
- E2E tests use 3-second timeout for Realtime subscriptions
- Production environment has <1 second latency

### 3. Browser Compatibility
- SLA countdown uses `setInterval` for updates (supported by all modern browsers)
- Supabase Realtime requires WebSocket support (IE11 not supported)
- Accessibility features tested with NVDA/JAWS on Windows, VoiceOver on macOS

## Test Results Summary

### Contract Tests (Backend API Validation)

#### GET /search (T018)
- **Status**: 12/14 passing (86%)
- **Failures**:
  1. Empty query error message wording (minor)
  2. Schema validation timeout (intermittent)
- **Performance**: p95 < 500ms ✅

#### GET /search-suggest (T019)
- **Status**: 16/18 passing (89%)
- **Failures**:
  1. Performance SLA <200ms (needs Redis optimization)
  2. Cache miss header validation
- **Performance**: p95 ~450ms (needs improvement)

#### POST /search-semantic (T020)
- **Status**: 9/21 passing (43%)
- **Failures**: Multiple validation and error handling issues
- **Root Cause**: Semantic search endpoint needs refinement
- **Action**: Defer full semantic search to post-MVP

**Overall Contract Test Score**: 37/53 passing (70%) ⚠️

| Typeahead Performance | ⏳ Not run | - | Target <200ms |
| Semantic Hybrid | ⏳ Not run | - | Needs refinement |
| RLS Enforcement | ⏳ Not run | - | Policies applied |
| Redis Fallback | ⏳ Not run | - | Graceful degradation |

**Overall Integration Test Score**: 2/8 executed, 2/2 passing (100% on executed) ⚠️

## Performance Metrics

| Metric | Target | Actual | Status |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| Suggestion Response Time (p100) | <200ms | ~450ms | ❌ Needs optimization |
| Search Results (p95) | <500ms | ~350ms | ✅ Meeting target |
| Concurrent Users | 50-100 | Not tested | ⏳ Pending load test |
| Dataset Size | 10k-50k entities | ~5k (seed data) | ✅ Scalable design |

---

## Known Issues & Limitations

### High Priority
1. **Suggestion Performance**: Not meeting <200ms target (currently ~450ms)
   - **Cause**: Redis cache not fully implemented in Edge Functions
   - **Fix**: Implement Redis client in search-suggest function
   - **Timeline**: 1-2 days

2. **Semantic Search Validation**: 12/21 contract tests failing
   - **Cause**: Edge Function missing validation logic
   - **Fix**: Add input validation and error handling
   - **Timeline**: 2-3 days

### Medium Priority
3. **Empty Query Error Message**: Test expects "query" in error message
   - **Cause**: Error message wording doesn't include "query" word
   - **Fix**: Update error message text (already done)
   - **Timeline**: Deployed ✅

4. **Cache Hit Headers**: X-Cache-Hit header not always present
   - **Cause**: Header only set when cache actually checked
   - **Fix**: Always include header with true/false value
   - **Timeline**: 1 day

### Low Priority (Deferred to Post-MVP)
5. **E2E Tests Not Executed**: Playwright tests written but not run
   - **Action**: Run in CI/CD pipeline
6. **Performance Load Test**: 50 concurrent user test pending
   - **Action**: Run with k6 in staging environment
7. **Quickstart Manual Validation**: Needs manual QA walkthrough
   - **Action**: Schedule with GASTAT team

## Compliance Check

### Constitutional Principles

| Principle | Status | Evidence |
|-----------|--------|----------|
| §1 Bilingual Excellence | ✅ | Arabic/English search, RTL/LTR UI, bilingual errors |
| §2 Type Safety | ✅ | TypeScript strict mode, Zod validation |
| §3 Security-First | ✅ | RLS policies, rate limiting, input sanitization, SQL injection prevention |
| §4 Data Sovereignty | ✅ | Self-hosted PostgreSQL (Supabase), Redis (containerized), no external search services |
| §5 Resilient Architecture | ✅ | Redis fallback, error boundaries, timeout controls, graceful degradation |
| §6 Accessibility | ⚠️ | ARIA labels, keyboard nav (not fully tested) |
| §7 Container-First | ✅ | Redis containerized, Edge Functions serverless |

**Overall Compliance**: 6/7 fully compliant, 1/7 partial (accessibility needs testing) ✅

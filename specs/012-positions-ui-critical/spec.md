## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-01
- Q: Who is authorized to attach/detach positions to/from engagements? ‚Üí A: Dossier Collaborators - Any user with edit access to the parent dossier can manage positions
- Q: What should happen when a position is deleted but is attached to multiple engagements? ‚Üí A: Prevent Deletion - System blocks deletion if position is attached to any engagement; user must detach first
- Q: What is the maximum acceptable response time for position search results? ‚Üí A: < 1 second - Near-instant response required for optimal UX
- Q: How should the system handle briefing pack generation when positions are in a different language than the selected briefing pack language? ‚Üí A: Auto-Translate - Automatically translate positions to match briefing pack language using AI/translation service
- Q: What is the maximum number of positions that can be attached to a single engagement without performance degradation? ‚Üí A: 100 positions - High capacity for comprehensive briefings

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a policy analyst or executive, I need to access organizational positions (talking points) in multiple contexts - whether I'm working on a general dossier, preparing for a specific engagement, or searching the centralized positions library. When preparing for engagements, I need the system to intelligently suggest relevant positions based on the engagement's context, and I need to be able to compile these into a professional briefing pack that can be shared with stakeholders in both English and Arabic.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a user is viewing a dossier detail page, **When** they click on the "Positions" tab, **Then** they should see all positions associated with that dossier context, with the ability to view, search, and filter positions relevant to the dossier.

2. **Given** a dossier collaborator (user with edit access to the parent dossier) is viewing an engagement detail page, **When** they navigate to the positions section, **Then** they should see:
   - Currently attached positions to this engagement
   - AI-suggested positions ranked by relevance to the engagement context
   - Ability to attach/detach positions with one click (if authorized)

3. **Given** a user wants to attach a position to an engagement, **When** they click "Add Position", **Then** a searchable dialog appears showing:
   - All available positions in the system
   - Search and filter capabilities
   - Preview of position content
   - Ability to select and attach positions

4. **Given** a user has attached positions to an engagement, **When** they click "Generate Briefing Pack", **Then** the system should:
   - Compile the engagement details and all attached positions
   - Generate a professional PDF in the user's selected language (English or Arabic)
   - Apply the organization's branding template
   - Make the PDF available for download and sharing

5. **Given** a user is in the standalone positions library (/positions), **When** they search for positions, **Then** they should see all positions across all dossiers with full search, filter, and navigation capabilities.

6. **Given** a user views a position from within a dossier context, **When** they click on a related engagement, **Then** they should be navigated to that engagement's detail page with the positions section highlighted.

### Edge Cases

- What happens when an engagement has no suggested positions (no relevant positions exist or AI service unavailable)?
  - System should gracefully show empty state with manual search option

- How does the system handle briefing pack generation when the selected language differs from the position's primary language?
  - System automatically translates positions to match the briefing pack language using AI/translation service, ensuring all content is presented in a unified language

- What happens when a position is deleted but is attached to multiple engagements?
  - System must prevent deletion and display error message listing all engagements using the position; user must detach from all engagements before deletion is allowed

- How does the system prioritize positions when multiple positions have similar relevance scores?
  - [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What's the tiebreaker logic - recency, author priority, manual curation?]

- What happens when briefing pack generation fails or times out?
  - System should provide error feedback and allow retry without losing context

- How are position usage statistics calculated for analytics?
  - [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What constitutes "usage" - views, attachments, briefing pack inclusions, or combination?]

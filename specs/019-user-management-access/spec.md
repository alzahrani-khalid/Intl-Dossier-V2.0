# Feature Specification: User Management & Access Control

**Feature Branch**: `019-user-management-access`
**Created**: 2025-10-11
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "User Management & Access Control Specification - Status: ⚠️ Partial (RBAC implemented, but user lifecycle not fully specified). Why Critical: Improper access control in a government system is a security and compliance risk."

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-11

- Q: What approval mechanism should be used for admin role assignments? → A: Requires approval from TWO administrators (dual control)
- Q: What should happen to active user sessions when their role is changed? → A: Immediately terminate all active sessions (user must re-login to get new permissions)
- Q: When a deactivated user account is reactivated, how should permissions be handled? → A: Require approval to restore previous permissions (security review)
- Q: What is the maximum allowed depth for delegation chains? → A: No transitive delegation allowed (only direct grantor to grantee)
- Q: How should users reset forgotten passwords? → A: MFA-based reset (if MFA enabled) with email backup

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - User Onboarding & Profile Creation (Priority: P1)

A new employee joins the organization and needs system access. The HR team creates their account, assigns initial roles based on their position, and the new user receives credentials to activate their account.

**Why this priority**: This is the foundation of user lifecycle management. Without proper onboarding, no other user management features can function. It's the entry point for all users into the system.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating a new user account, assigning a role, and verifying the user can log in with proper access levels without dependencies on other workflows.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an HR administrator is logged in, **When** they create a new user account with email, full name, and initial role, **Then** the system creates the account and sends an activation email to the user
2. **Given** a new user receives an activation email, **When** they click the activation link and set their password, **Then** their account is activated and they can log in
3. **Given** a user is being created, **When** the email or username already exists in the system, **Then** the system prevents duplicate creation and displays a clear error message
4. **Given** a user account is created, **When** the system creates the profile, **Then** default preferences (language: en, timezone: UTC, role: viewer) are automatically assigned

---

### User Story 2 - Role Assignment & Permission Management (Priority: P1)

An administrator needs to assign roles to users or update existing roles based on organizational changes, promotions, or job function changes. The system must support role-based access control with proper audit trails.

**Why this priority**: Role management is critical for access control and security. Without this, users cannot be granted appropriate permissions to perform their work, and security policies cannot be enforced.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by assigning/updating roles for existing users and verifying the corresponding permission changes take effect immediately.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an administrator views a user's profile, **When** they change the user's role from "viewer" to "editor", **Then** the role is updated and the user immediately gains editor permissions
2. **Given** a role change is requested, **When** the change affects sensitive permissions (e.g., viewer to admin), **Then** the system requires dual approval from two distinct administrators before applying the admin role assignment
3. **Given** a role is assigned to a user, **When** the assignment is saved, **Then** the system logs who made the change, when, and the old/new roles in the audit trail
4. **Given** a user has multiple role assignments through delegation, **When** their primary role is changed, **Then** the system clearly indicates which permissions come from the primary role vs delegated permissions

---

### User Story 3 - Temporary Access & Permission Delegation (Priority: P2)

A manager needs to delegate their approval authority to a colleague during vacation, or grant temporary access to a contractor for a specific project. The system must support time-bound permission delegation with automatic expiration.

**Why this priority**: Delegation enables business continuity when key personnel are unavailable. While not as critical as basic role management, it prevents workflow bottlenecks and maintains productivity.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by creating a temporary delegation, verifying the grantee has access during the valid period, and confirming automatic revocation after expiration.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a manager has permissions on specific dossiers, **When** they delegate these permissions to another user with a start date, end date, and reason, **Then** the delegate receives the specified permissions only during the valid period
2. **Given** a delegation is active, **When** the end date is reached, **Then** the system automatically revokes the delegated permissions and notifies both users
3. **Given** a user attempts to delegate permissions, **When** they try to delegate permissions they don't have, **Then** the system prevents the delegation and shows an error message
4. **Given** a circular delegation would occur (A delegates to B, B tries to delegate back to A for the same resource), **When** the second delegation is attempted, **Then** the system detects and prevents the circular reference
5. **Given** delegations are expiring soon, **When** the system runs daily checks, **Then** users are notified 7 days before their delegated permissions expire

---

### User Story 4 - User Deactivation & Offboarding (Priority: P1)

When an employee leaves the organization, HR needs to deactivate their account, revoke all access, transfer ownership of their work items, and maintain audit compliance.

**Why this priority**: Improper offboarding creates security vulnerabilities (orphaned accounts) and compliance violations. This is critical for organizational security and regulatory compliance.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by deactivating a user account and verifying all access is revoked, sessions are terminated, and work items are properly handled.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an HR administrator views a user profile, **When** they deactivate the user account, **Then** the account is marked inactive, all active sessions are terminated, and the user cannot log in
2. **Given** a user is being deactivated, **When** they own dossiers, assignments, or pending approvals, **Then** the system keeps ownership but marks items as "orphaned" with warning indicators for administrators to review and selectively reassign
3. **Given** a deactivated user account exists, **When** any user views references to this user (e.g., in audit logs, comments), **Then** the system clearly indicates the user is deactivated
4. **Given** a user has been deactivated, **When** delegations they granted are still active, **Then** all their granted delegations are automatically revoked
5. **Given** a user is deactivated, **When** the action is completed, **Then** the system logs who deactivated the account, when, and the reason (if provided)

---

### User Story 5 - Access Review & Recertification (Priority: P2)

Security administrators need to periodically review user access rights to ensure compliance with the principle of least privilege and detect privilege creep or unauthorized access.

**Why this priority**: Regular access reviews are required for security compliance (SOC2, ISO 27001) and prevent privilege accumulation over time. While important, it can be implemented after core user lifecycle features.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by generating access review reports for users or departments and verifying managers can certify or request changes to access rights.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a security administrator initiates an access review, **When** they specify a review period and user scope (department, role, or all users), **Then** the system generates a comprehensive report of user roles, permissions, and delegations
2. **Given** an access review is in progress, **When** a manager reviews their team members' access, **Then** they can certify access as appropriate or flag for change
3. **Given** access review results identify users with excessive permissions, **When** the review is completed, **Then** the system generates recommended actions for administrators
4. **Given** the system supports automatic quarterly access review scheduling, **When** a review date approaches or an administrator manually initiates a review, **Then** the system begins the access review process with manual override capability for scheduling adjustments
5. **Given** a user has not logged in for 90 days, **When** the access review runs, **Then** the inactive account is flagged for review and potential deactivation

---

### User Story 6 - Guest User Management (Priority: P3)

External stakeholders (e.g., representatives from partner organizations) need temporary, limited access to specific resources without full employee accounts.

**Why this priority**: Guest access enables collaboration with external parties while maintaining security boundaries. Lower priority as it serves a specific use case that may not be immediately needed.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by creating a guest account with restricted access to specific resources and verifying they cannot access other system areas.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an administrator needs to grant external access, **When** they create a guest account with specific resource permissions and expiration date, **Then** the guest user receives access only to permitted resources until expiration
2. **Given** a guest user account is created, **When** the expiration date is reached, **Then** the account is automatically deactivated and the guest cannot log in
3. **Given** a guest user is active, **When** they attempt to access resources outside their permitted scope, **Then** the system denies access and logs the attempt
4. **Given** guest accounts exist in the system, **When** administrators view user lists, **Then** guest accounts are clearly distinguished from employee accounts with visual indicators

### Edge Cases

- When a user's role is changed while they have active sessions, all sessions are immediately terminated and the user must re-login to obtain new permissions
- Transitive delegation chains are prohibited - only the original permission holder can delegate, and recipients cannot re-delegate those permissions to others
- When a deactivated user account is reactivated, restoration of previous permissions requires administrator approval through security review process
- How are conflicts resolved when a user has contradictory permissions from different sources (direct role vs delegation)?
- What happens when a delegation's grantor is deactivated or has their own permissions revoked?
- How does the system prevent administrators from accidentally locking themselves out by changing their own role?
- What happens when bulk role changes affect hundreds of users simultaneously? (Performance considerations)
- How are orphaned delegations handled (where both grantor and grantee are deactivated)?

- **FR-031**: System MUST restrict guest users to read-only access unless explicitly granted additional permissions

**Permission Conflict Resolution**
- **FR-032**: System MUST resolve permission conflicts using the following precedence: direct role assignment > active delegations. When a user has contradictory permissions from multiple sources, the system MUST apply the most permissive grant (e.g., if role=viewer but delegation grants editor access, editor permissions apply)

### Key Entities

- **User**: Core identity entity representing system users with authentication credentials, profile information (email, username, full_name, avatar_url), role assignment, status (active/inactive), preferences (language, timezone), MFA settings, and activity tracking (last_login_at, created_at, updated_at)

- **Role**: Permission level assigned to users (admin, editor, viewer) that determines their base access rights across the system. Roles are hierarchical where admin > editor > viewer in terms of permissions.

- **Permission Delegation**: Time-bound grant of permissions from one user (grantor) to another user (grantee) for specific resources or system-wide, with tracking fields (delegated_by, valid_from, valid_until, is_active, revoked_at, revoked_by) and validation to prevent circular dependencies

- **Audit Log**: Immutable record of all user management actions capturing who performed what action, when, on which user, and what changed (old_value, new_value), used for compliance reporting and security investigations

- **User Session**: Active authentication session tracking user login state, session token, IP address, user agent, and expiration time, enabling multi-device access and security monitoring

- **Access Review**: Periodic certification of user access rights conducted by managers or security administrators, recording review date, scope, reviewer, findings (users reviewed, access certified, changes requested), and compliance status

- **Guest Account**: Specialized user type for external stakeholders with restricted access scope (specific resources only), mandatory expiration date, limited permissions (typically read-only), and clear visual distinction from employee accounts

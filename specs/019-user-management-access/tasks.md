# Tasks: User Management & Access Control

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/019-user-management-access/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md, data-model.md, contracts/, research.md, quickstart.md

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

**Note**: Tests are NOT included in this implementation plan as they were not explicitly requested in the feature specification.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (US1-US6)
- All paths use web app structure: `backend/` and `frontend/`

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3-8)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories can proceed in priority order: P1 stories (US1, US2, US4) ‚Üí P2 stories (US3, US5) ‚Üí P3 stories (US6)
  - Or in parallel if team capacity allows (after Foundational phase)
- **Polish (Phase 9)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 4 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Uses delegation revocation logic but independently testable
- **User Story 3 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Independently testable
- **User Story 5 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Uses user/delegation data but independently testable
- **User Story 6 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Extends US1 but independently testable

### Within Each User Story

- Edge Functions before frontend API clients
- API clients before hooks
- Hooks before components
- Core implementation before integration
- Story complete before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

- **Phase 1 (Setup)**: All tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (T001, T002, T003)
- **Phase 2 (Foundational)**: Tasks T006-T011 can run in parallel (table migrations), T017-T020b can run in parallel (middleware/utils/password reset)
- **Within User Stories**: All tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (includes T038a-T038b for MFA setup)
- **Across User Stories**: After Foundational phase completes, all user stories can be worked on in parallel by different team members

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1

```bash
# Launch Edge Functions in parallel:
Task T021: "Implement create-user Edge Function in supabase/functions/create-user/index.ts"
Task T022: "Implement activate-account Edge Function in supabase/functions/activate-account/index.ts"

# These can run in parallel because they're in different files
```

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 3

```bash
# Launch all Edge Functions for delegation in parallel:
Task T048: "Implement delegate-permissions Edge Function in supabase/functions/delegate-permissions/index.ts"
Task T049: "Implement revoke-delegation Edge Function in supabase/functions/revoke-delegation/index.ts"
Task T050: "Implement validate-delegation Edge Function in supabase/functions/validate-delegation/index.ts"
Task T051: "Implement my-delegations Edge Function in supabase/functions/my-delegations/index.ts"

# All different files, no dependencies between them
```

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story (US1-US6) for traceability
- Each user story is independently completable and testable
- Foundational phase (T004-T020b) BLOCKS all user story work - must complete first
- Tests are NOT included as they were not requested in the specification
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- All components must be mobile-first with RTL support (Arabic/English)
- All Edge Functions require admin authorization except activate-account, initiate-password-reset, and reset-password (public)

**Date**: 2025-01-27  
**Feature**: 003-resolve-critical-issues  
**Status**: Complete

## Research Summary

This research addresses the resolution of 20+ critical clarification markers from spec 002, focusing on performance criteria, security requirements, entity definitions, workflow states, and deployment architecture for the GASTAT International Dossier System.

## Technology Stack Research

### Frontend Architecture
**Decision**: React 18+ with TypeScript, Vite, TanStack Router, TanStack Query, Tailwind CSS  
**Rationale**: 
- React 18+ provides concurrent features and improved performance
- TypeScript strict mode ensures type safety per constitution
- Vite offers fast development and build times
- TanStack Router provides type-safe routing with excellent TypeScript integration
- TanStack Query handles server state management efficiently
- Tailwind CSS enables rapid UI development with consistent design system

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Next.js: Rejected due to complexity and server-side rendering not required
- Vue.js: Rejected due to team expertise in React
- SASS/SCSS: Rejected in favor of Tailwind for consistency

### Backend Architecture
**Decision**: Supabase (PostgreSQL + RLS + Auth + Realtime + Storage) with RESTful APIs  
**Rationale**:
- Supabase provides complete backend-as-a-service with PostgreSQL
- Row Level Security (RLS) policies ensure data sovereignty compliance
- Built-in authentication with MFA support
- Real-time subscriptions for live updates
- File storage with 50MB limit support
- Self-hostable for data sovereignty requirements

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Firebase: Rejected due to external cloud dependency
- Custom Express.js: Rejected due to development overhead
- Prisma + PostgreSQL: Rejected in favor of Supabase's integrated solution

### AI Integration
**Decision**: AnythingLLM (self-hosted) with pgvector for embeddings  
**Rationale**:
- AnythingLLM provides local AI capabilities for data sovereignty
- pgvector enables vector similarity search for intelligence analysis
- Fallback mechanisms ensure system resilience
- Containerized deployment aligns with constitution

**Alternatives Considered**:
- OpenAI API: Rejected due to external dependency
- Local LLM models: Rejected due to resource requirements
- Hugging Face: Rejected due to external dependency

## Performance Research

### Response Time Optimization
**Decision**: <500ms response time (95th percentile), 300 requests/minute per user  
**Rationale**:
- 500ms provides excellent user experience
- 300 req/min prevents abuse while allowing normal usage
- Caching strategy: 5 minutes for lists, 1 minute for details
- Database indexing on frequently queried fields

**Implementation Strategy**:
- Redis caching for frequently accessed data
- Database query optimization with proper indexes
- CDN for static assets
- Lazy loading for large datasets

### File Upload Optimization
**Decision**: 50MB file upload limit with 2-second processing time  
**Rationale**:
- 50MB accommodates large documents while preventing abuse
- 2-second processing ensures responsive user experience
- Chunked upload for large files
- Client-side validation before upload

## Security Research

### Authentication & Authorization
**Decision**: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) mandatory for all users  
**Rationale**:
- MFA provides strong security for sensitive government data
- Supabase supports TOTP and SMS-based MFA
- Row Level Security (RLS) policies enforce data access control
- Rate limiting prevents brute force attacks

**Implementation Strategy**:
- TOTP-based MFA as primary method
- SMS backup for recovery
- Session management with secure tokens
- Automatic logout on permission changes

### Data Protection
**Decision**: Encryption at rest and in transit, input validation, security logging  
**Rationale**:
- Government data requires highest security standards
- Encryption protects against data breaches
- Input validation prevents injection attacks
- Security logging enables audit trails

## Bilingual Support Research

### RTL/LTR Implementation
**Decision**: Seamless language switching with cultural conventions  
**Rationale**:
- Arabic and English are both official languages
- RTL layout required for proper Arabic display
- Cultural conventions ensure appropriate date/number formatting
- WCAG 2.1 AA compliance for accessibility

**Implementation Strategy**:
- i18next for internationalization
- CSS logical properties for RTL support
- Separate translation files for each language
- Cultural formatting libraries for dates/numbers

## Testing Strategy Research

### Test Coverage
**Decision**: 80% unit test coverage, integration tests for APIs, E2E tests for critical flows  
**Rationale**:
- 80% coverage ensures code quality while being achievable
- Integration tests validate API contracts
- E2E tests ensure critical user journeys work
- Accessibility testing ensures WCAG compliance

**Testing Tools**:
- Vitest for unit tests (faster than Jest)
- Playwright for E2E tests (cross-browser support)
- axe-playwright for accessibility testing
- Jest for integration tests

## Deployment Architecture Research

### Containerization
**Decision**: Docker containers with Docker Compose orchestration  
**Rationale**:
- Containerization ensures consistent deployment
- Docker Compose simplifies multi-service management
- Health checks enable proper monitoring
- Self-hostable for data sovereignty

**Infrastructure Components**:
- Frontend container (React app)
- Backend container (Supabase)
- AI container (AnythingLLM)
- Database container (PostgreSQL)
- Reverse proxy (Traefik)
- Monitoring (Prometheus/Grafana)

## Entity Relationship Research

### Core Entities
**Decision**: 10 core entities with complete relationships and validation rules  
**Rationale**:
- Entities represent core business concepts
- Relationships enable data integrity
- Validation rules ensure data quality
- Workflow states manage entity lifecycles

**Entity Specifications**:
- User: Authentication, permissions, language preferences
- Country: Multilingual names, ISO codes, regions
- Organization: Hierarchical structure, country associations
- MoU: Document versioning, workflow states
- Event: Scheduling, conflict detection, calendar integration
- Intelligence Report: Analysis metadata, confidence levels
- Data Library Item: File management, access controls
- Permission Delegation: Role-based access control

## Workflow State Research

### MoU Workflow
**Decision**: Draft → Internal Review → External Review → Negotiation → Signed → Active → Renewed/Expired  
**Rationale**:
- Workflow reflects real-world document approval process
- State transitions ensure proper document lifecycle
- Audit trail for compliance requirements
- Role-based permissions for each state

### Intelligence Report Workflow
**Decision**: Draft → Review → Approved → Published  
**Rationale**:
- Simplified workflow for intelligence reports
- Review process ensures quality control
- Published state enables distribution
- Version control for report updates

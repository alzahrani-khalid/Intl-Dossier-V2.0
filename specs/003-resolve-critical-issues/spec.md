## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As a system administrator and end user, I need a fully functional GASTAT International Dossier System with all critical issues resolved so that I can efficiently manage international relations, documents, and intelligence data with confidence in system reliability, performance, and security.

### Acceptance Scenarios

#### Performance & Response Time Requirements
1. **Given** a user performs a country search, **When** they submit the query, **Then** results are returned within 500ms (95th percentile)
2. **Given** a user navigates to any page, **When** the page loads, **Then** it displays within 500ms for initial load
3. **Given** a user uploads a document up to 50MB, **When** the upload completes, **Then** the system processes it within 2 seconds
4. **Given** multiple users access the system, **When** they make concurrent requests, **Then** the system handles 300 requests per minute per user without degradation

#### Security & Access Control
5. **Given** a user attempts to access a restricted route, **When** they lack proper permissions, **Then** they are redirected to an appropriate error page
6. **Given** a user logs in, **When** MFA is enabled, **Then** they must complete two-factor authentication
7. **Given** any data input, **When** it contains malicious content, **Then** the system sanitizes and validates it before processing

#### Data Management & Workflows
8. **Given** a user creates an MoU document, **When** they save it, **Then** it enters the Draft state and can progress through: Internal Review ‚Üí External Review ‚Üí Negotiation ‚Üí Signed ‚Üí Active ‚Üí Renewed/Expired
9. **Given** a user schedules an event, **When** there's a time conflict, **Then** the system displays conflict details and prevents double-booking
10. **Given** a user searches for countries, **When** they apply filters, **Then** results are filtered by name, region, status, and ISO codes

#### Bilingual & Accessibility
11. **Given** a user switches language, **When** they change from English to Arabic, **Then** all interface elements display in RTL layout with proper cultural conventions
12. **Given** a user with visual impairments, **When** they navigate using screen readers, **Then** all content is properly announced and follows WCAG 2.1 AA standards

#### AI Integration & Intelligence
13. **Given** a user requests intelligence analysis, **When** AnythingLLM is available, **Then** the system provides trend analysis and pattern detection
14. **Given** AnythingLLM is unavailable, **When** a user requests AI features, **Then** the system gracefully falls back to basic functionality

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a user uploads a file exceeding 50MB? ‚Üí System rejects upload with clear error message
- How does the system handle event conflicts involving multiple overlapping events? ‚Üí System shows all conflicts and requires user resolution
- What occurs when deleted entities are referenced in related modules? ‚Üí System shows "deleted" status and prevents further operations
- How does the system handle permission changes during active sessions? ‚Üí System validates permissions on each request and logs out if access is revoked

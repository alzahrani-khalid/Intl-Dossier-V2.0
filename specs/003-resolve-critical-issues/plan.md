# Implementation Plan: Resolve Critical Issues in Core Module Implementation

**Branch**: `003-resolve-critical-issues` | **Date**: 2025-01-27 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/003-resolve-critical-issues/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Fill the Constitution Check section based on the content of the constitution document.
4. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
5. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
6. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file (e.g., `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for GitHub Copilot, `GEMINI.md` for Gemini CLI, `QWEN.md` for Qwen Code or `AGENTS.md` for opencode).
7. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
8. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
9. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:
- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary
Resolve all critical issues identified in spec 002 by implementing comprehensive solutions for frontend routes, backend API completion, core business logic, and testing infrastructure. The implementation will address 20+ clarification markers with specific performance criteria, security requirements, entity definitions, workflow states, and deployment architecture. Technical approach focuses on TypeScript strict mode, bilingual support, container-first deployment, and AI integration with fallback mechanisms.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: TypeScript 5.0+ (strict mode), React 18+, Node.js 18+  
**Primary Dependencies**: Supabase (PostgreSQL + RLS + Auth + Realtime + Storage), Vite, TanStack Router, TanStack Query, Tailwind CSS, AnythingLLM, pgvector  
**Storage**: PostgreSQL via Supabase with Row Level Security (RLS) policies  
**Testing**: Vitest (unit), Playwright (E2E), Jest (integration), axe-playwright (accessibility)  
**Target Platform**: Web application (Chrome 90+, Firefox 88+, Safari 14+, Edge 90+), Docker containers  
**Project Type**: web (frontend + backend architecture)  
**Performance Goals**: <500ms response time (95th percentile), 300 requests/minute per user, <500ms page load  
**Constraints**: 50MB file upload limit, WCAG 2.1 AA compliance, bilingual RTL/LTR support, offline AI fallback  
**Scale/Scope**: Multi-user system with 10 core entities, 100+ API endpoints, 30+ React components, 80% test coverage

```

**Structure Decision**: Option 2 (Web application) - Frontend + Backend architecture detected

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:
   - For each NEEDS CLARIFICATION → research task
   - For each dependency → best practices task
   - For each integration → patterns task

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:
   ```
   For each unknown in Technical Context:
     Task: "Research {unknown} for {feature context}"
   For each technology choice:
     Task: "Find best practices for {tech} in {domain}"
   ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
   - Decision: [what was chosen]
   - Rationale: [why chosen]
   - Alternatives considered: [what else evaluated]

**Output**: research.md with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
   - Entity name, fields, relationships
   - Validation rules from requirements
   - State transitions if applicable

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:
   - For each user action → endpoint
   - Use standard REST/GraphQL patterns
   - Output OpenAPI/GraphQL schema to `/contracts/`

3. **Generate contract tests** from contracts:
   - One test file per endpoint
   - Assert request/response schemas
   - Tests must fail (no implementation yet)

4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories:
   - Each story → integration test scenario
   - Quickstart test = story validation steps

5. **Update agent file incrementally** (O(1) operation):
   - Run `.specify/scripts/bash/update-agent-context.sh claude`
     **IMPORTANT**: Execute it exactly as specified above. Do not add or remove any arguments.
   - If exists: Add only NEW tech from current plan
   - Preserve manual additions between markers
   - Update recent changes (keep last 3)
   - Keep under 150 lines for token efficiency
   - Output to repository root

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, failing tests, quickstart.md, agent-specific file

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Load `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` as base
- Generate tasks from Phase 1 design docs (contracts, data model, quickstart)
- Each contract → contract test task [P]
- Each entity → model creation task [P] 
- Each user story → integration test task
- Implementation tasks to make tests pass

**Ordering Strategy**:
- TDD order: Tests before implementation 
- Dependency order: Models before services before UI
- Mark [P] for parallel execution (independent files)

**Task Categories**:
1. **Infrastructure Setup** (5-7 tasks)
   - Docker configuration updates
   - Environment variable setup
   - Database migration scripts
   - Health check endpoints

2. **Data Model Implementation** (8-10 tasks)
   - Entity model creation (10 entities)
   - Database schema updates
   - Relationship definitions
   - Validation rules implementation

3. **API Contract Implementation** (12-15 tasks)
   - Authentication endpoints
   - CRUD operations for all entities
   - Search and filtering endpoints
   - File upload endpoints
   - Workflow state management

4. **Frontend Implementation** (15-18 tasks)
   - Route definitions and navigation
   - Component creation for all modules
   - Bilingual support implementation
   - RTL/LTR layout switching
   - Form validation and error handling

5. **Security Implementation** (6-8 tasks)
   - MFA integration
   - RLS policy implementation
   - Input validation and sanitization
   - Rate limiting configuration
   - Security logging setup

6. **AI Integration** (4-6 tasks)
   - AnythingLLM integration
   - pgvector setup and configuration
   - Fallback mechanism implementation
   - Intelligence analysis endpoints

7. **Testing Implementation** (10-12 tasks)
   - Unit tests for all services
   - Integration tests for APIs
   - E2E tests for critical flows
   - Accessibility testing setup
   - Performance testing configuration

8. **Performance Optimization** (5-7 tasks)
   - Caching implementation
   - Database query optimization
   - File upload optimization
   - Response time monitoring

**Estimated Output**: 65-83 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)  
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)  
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking
*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |


## Progress Tracking
*This checklist is updated during execution flow*

**Phase Status**:
- [x] Phase 0: Research complete (/plan command)
- [x] Phase 1: Design complete (/plan command)
- [x] Phase 2: Task planning complete (/plan command - describe approach only)

**Gate Status**:

# Tasks: Mobile Application for GASTAT International Dossier System

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/018-create-an-expo/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md, research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: Tests are NOT explicitly requested in the feature specification, so test tasks are EXCLUDED from this task list per the template guidelines.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
Based on plan.md structure:
- **Mobile app**: `mobile/` directory at repository root
- **Components**: `mobile/components/`
- **Services**: `mobile/services/`
- **Database**: `mobile/database/`
- **Hooks**: `mobile/hooks/`
- **Screens**: `mobile/app/`

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3-9)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories can then proceed in parallel (if staffed)
  - Or sequentially in priority order (P1 ‚Üí P2 ‚Üí P3)
  - **MVP Focus**: User Stories 1 + 2 (P1) provide core authentication and offline dossier viewing
- **Polish (Phase 10)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1) - Login/Biometrics**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P1) - Offline Dossiers**: Depends on Foundational phase and integrates with US1 (requires authentication) but is independently testable once auth exists
- **User Story 3 (P2) - Notifications**: Can start after Foundational - Integrates with US1 (requires auth) and US2 (navigates to dossiers) but is independently testable
- **User Story 4 (P2) - Briefs**: Can start after Foundational - Integrates with US1 (requires auth) and US2 (links to dossiers) but is independently testable
- **User Story 5 (P3) - Intake Requests**: Can start after Foundational - Integrates with US1 (requires auth) but is independently testable
- **User Story 6 (P2) - Language Switching**: Can start after Foundational - Affects all UIs but is independently testable
- **User Story 7 (P2) - Auto Sync**: Depends on US2 (uses SyncService) but is independently testable by simulating network changes

### Within Each User Story

- Models before services (WatermelonDB models ‚Üí SyncService, AuthService)
- Services before hooks (AuthService ‚Üí useAuth hook)
- Hooks before components (useAuth ‚Üí login screen)
- Core implementation before integration (login screen ‚Üí biometric prompt)
- Story complete before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

- **Phase 1 (Setup)**: All tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- **Phase 2 (Foundational)**: All WatermelonDB model tasks (T012-T022) can run in parallel, translation files (T026-T027) can run in parallel, type definitions (T030-T032) can run in parallel
- **Once Foundational completes**: All user stories (US1-US7) can start in parallel if team capacity allows
- **Within User Story 2**: DossierCard, CountryList, OrganizationList, PositionList components (T056-T058) can run in parallel
- **Within User Story 3**: NotificationCard component and notification handlers (T072, T069) can run in parallel after NotificationService exists

## Parallel Example: Foundational Phase (Phase 2)

```bash
# Launch all WatermelonDB model creation tasks together:
Task: "Create WatermelonDB model for User in mobile/database/models/User.ts"
Task: "Create WatermelonDB model for Dossier in mobile/database/models/Dossier.ts"

# Launch translation file creation in parallel:
Task: "Create English translation files in mobile/i18n/en/ (common.json, dossiers.json, briefs.json, auth.json, profile.json, notifications.json)"
Task: "Create Arabic translation files in mobile/i18n/ar/ (common.json, dossiers.json, briefs.json, auth.json, profile.json, notifications.json)"

# Launch type definition creation in parallel:

Task: "Create TypeScript types in mobile/types/navigation.ts"
```

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1 (Login & Biometrics)

```bash
# Launch AuthService and TokenStorage creation in parallel:
Task: "Create AuthService in mobile/services/auth/AuthService.ts"
Task: "Create TokenStorage service in mobile/services/auth/TokenStorage.ts"

# After services exist, launch components in parallel:
Task: "Create login screen in mobile/app/login.tsx"
Task: "Create loading spinner component in mobile/components/ui/LoadingSpinner.tsx"
Task: "Implement biometric prompt component in mobile/components/shared/BiometricPrompt.tsx"
```

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 2 (Offline Dossiers)

```bash
# Launch sync services in parallel:
Task: "Create SyncService in mobile/services/sync/SyncService.ts"
Task: "Implement WatermelonDB sync adapter in mobile/database/sync.ts"

# Launch list components in parallel after models exist:
Task: "Create CountryList component in mobile/components/dossiers/CountryList.tsx"
Task: "Create OrganizationList component in mobile/components/dossiers/OrganizationList.tsx"

Task: "Create OfflineBanner component in mobile/components/shared/OfflineBanner.tsx"
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Stories 1 + 2 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup ‚Üí Project structure and dependencies ready
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL) ‚Üí Database, i18n, navigation, theme ready
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (Login/Biometrics) ‚Üí Authentication works
4. Complete Phase 4: User Story 2 (Offline Dossiers) ‚Üí Core value delivered
5. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test both stories independently, verify offline dossier viewing after login
6. Deploy/demo if ready ‚Üí **This is the MVP!**

### Incremental Delivery (Add More Stories)

1. Complete MVP (Setup + Foundational + US1 + US2) ‚Üí Foundation + core value ready
2. Add User Story 3 (Notifications) ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
3. Add User Story 6 (Language Switching) ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
4. Add User Story 7 (Auto Sync) ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
5. Add User Story 4 (Briefs) ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
6. Add User Story 5 (Intake Requests) ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
7. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together (all hands on deck for foundation)
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 1 (Login/Biometrics)
   - Developer B: User Story 2 (Offline Dossiers) - starts models/services
   - Developer C: User Story 6 (Language Switching) - works on i18n infrastructure
3. After US1 complete:
   - Developer A moves to User Story 3 (Notifications)
4. Stories complete and integrate independently

## Notes

- **[P] tasks**: Different files, no dependencies - can run in parallel
- **[Story] label**: Maps task to specific user story for traceability
- **Tests excluded**: Tests are NOT explicitly requested in feature spec, so test tasks are omitted per template guidelines
- **Each user story**: Independently completable and testable
- **Commit strategy**: Commit after each task or logical group (e.g., all models for one story)
- **Stop at checkpoints**: Validate story independently before moving to next
- **MVP Focus**: User Stories 1 + 2 (P1 priority) deliver core value: secure login + offline dossier viewing
- **Avoid**: Vague tasks, same file conflicts, cross-story dependencies that break independence
- **Path Prefix**: All paths assume `mobile/` directory at repository root per plan.md
- **Accessibility**: All interactive components must meet WCAG AA (44x44px touch targets, 4.5:1 contrast)
- **RTL Support**: All components must support Arabic RTL layout with proper text direction and icon flipping
- **Offline-First**: SyncService handles all data fetching, WatermelonDB provides local cache, network changes trigger auto-sync

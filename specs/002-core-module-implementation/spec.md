# Feature Specification: Core Module Implementation

**Feature Branch**: `002-core-module-implementation`  
**Created**: 2025-09-26  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Core Module Implementation with four priority areas: Frontend Routes, Backend API Completion, Core Business Logic, and Testing Infrastructure"

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-09-26
- Q: What level of WCAG accessibility compliance is required for the system? ‚Üí A: WCAG 2.1 Level AA (recommended standard)
- Q: What should be the API rate limiting threshold for concurrent user requests? ‚Üí A: 300 requests per minute per user
- Q: What are the MoU document lifecycle workflow states? ‚Üí A: Draft ‚Üí Internal Review ‚Üí External Review ‚Üí Negotiation ‚Üí Signed ‚Üí Active ‚Üí Renewed/Expired
- Q: What is the maximum file size limit for document uploads? ‚Üí A: 50 MB per file
- Q: What is the minimum unit test coverage percentage required for backend services? ‚Üí A: 80% code coverage

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Parsed: Four-phase implementation plan for core system modules
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identified: navigation routes, API endpoints, business modules, testing framework
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Marked specific clarifications needed for each module
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí Defined user flows for each module type
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Created testable requirements for each priority area
6. Identify Key Entities
   ‚Üí Listed core business entities and their relationships
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí WARN "Spec has uncertainties - module-specific behaviors need clarification"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As a system user, I need to access all advertised modules in the application (Forums, MoUs, Events, Briefs, Intelligence, Reports, Data Library, Word Assistant, and Settings) so that I can perform my daily tasks efficiently. The system should provide consistent navigation, bilingual support (English/Arabic), and reliable data management for all core business entities.

### Acceptance Scenarios

#### Priority 1: Frontend Route Access
1. **Given** a user is logged into the system, **When** they click on "Forums & Conferences" in the sidebar, **Then** they are navigated to a functional Forums page with appropriate content
2. **Given** a user is viewing any module page, **When** they switch language from English to Arabic, **Then** all interface elements are properly translated
3. **Given** a user navigates to any new route, **When** the page loads, **Then** the sidebar correctly highlights the active route

#### Priority 2: Backend API Operations
4. **Given** a user performs any CRUD operation, **When** the request is processed, **Then** appropriate validation messages are displayed for invalid data
5. **Given** multiple users access the system simultaneously, **When** they make concurrent requests, **Then** the system handles them efficiently with rate limiting of 300 requests per minute per user

#### Priority 3: Core Business Logic
6. **Given** a user is managing countries data, **When** they search for a specific country, **Then** results are filtered and displayed within [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: acceptable response time]
7. **Given** a user is scheduling an event, **When** there's a time conflict with another event, **Then** the system alerts them with conflict details
8. **Given** a user uploads a document to MoUs module, **When** the upload completes, **Then** the document is tracked through workflow states (Draft ‚Üí Internal Review ‚Üí External Review ‚Üí Negotiation ‚Üí Signed ‚Üí Active ‚Üí Renewed/Expired)

#### Priority 4: Testing & Quality
9. **Given** any page in the application, **When** accessed with screen readers, **Then** all content is properly announced and navigable via keyboard
10. **Given** any API endpoint, **When** called with invalid authentication, **Then** it returns appropriate error responses

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a user tries to access a route without proper permissions?
- How does the system handle document uploads that exceed 50 MB?
- What occurs when event conflicts involve multiple overlapping events?
- How are deleted entities handled in related modules?

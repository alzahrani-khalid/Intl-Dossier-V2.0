# Feature Specification: Positions & Talking Points Lifecycle

**Feature Branch**: `011-positions-talking-points`
**Created**: 2025-10-01
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Positions & Talking Points Lifecycle ‚Äî Spec

Purpose: provide end‚Äëto‚Äëend drafting (bilingual), approvals, versioning, publication, and consistency checks.

## Goals

- CRUD for positions with provenance and bilingual content.
- Approval chains with status transitions and step‚Äëup on approve.
- Versioning with compare and supersede; publish for internal audiences.
- Integrate existing consistency analysis endpoints.

## UX

- List with facets (thematic, status, last updated, owner).
- Draft editor: EN/AR side‚Äëby‚Äëside, rationale, alignment, attachments.
- Approval view: diffs, comments, sign‚Äëoff.
- Consistency panel: conflicts with suggested resolutions.

## UI

- Routes: `/_protected/positions`, `/_protected/positions/:id`.
- Components: `PositionEditor`, `VersionDiff`, `ApprovalChain`, `ConsistencyPanel`.

## API

- `GET/POST /api/positions` (CRUD)
- `PUT /api/positions/:id/submit` (for review)
- `PUT /api/positions/:id/approve` (requires step‚Äëup)
- `PUT /api/positions/:id/publish`
- `GET /api/positions/:id/versions`
- Consistency endpoints exist; add `PUT /api/positions/consistency/:id/reconcile` usage in UI.

## AI

- Drafting assistant: initial bilingual text with citations.
- Translator with terminology memory; strength/stance calibration.
- Contradiction/ambiguity detection (feeds PositionConsistencyService).

## Acceptance

- Create ‚Üí submit ‚Üí approve ‚Üí publish flow; versions tracked; step‚Äëup enforced on approve.
- Consistency conflicts surfaced and reconciled; score updated."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Description provided with clear goals and features
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identified: actors (drafters, reviewers, approvers, consumers), actions (draft, review, approve, publish, reconcile), data (positions, talking points, versions, attachments), constraints (bilingual content, approval chains, step-up authentication)
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What defines "internal audiences" for publication - specific user roles or organizational units?]
   ‚Üí [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What is the maximum number of approval stages in the chain?]
   ‚Üí [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What happens to published positions when superseded - are they archived, marked obsolete, or deleted?]
   ‚Üí [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What are the specific thematic categories for faceted search?]
   ‚Üí [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What triggers consistency checks - manual request, automatic on save, or scheduled batch?]
   ‚Üí [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What is the retention policy for position versions?]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí User flows identified for drafting, approval, publication, and consistency management
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement is testable and mapped to user scenarios
6. Identify Key Entities
   ‚Üí Position, Version, Approval, Attachment, ConsistencyCheck
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí WARN "Spec has uncertainties marked with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning after clarifications)

**Note**: The [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers above (lines 56-61) are historical documentation of the specification generation process. All items have been resolved in the "Clarifications" section (lines 75-82) and throughout the Requirements section.

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
A policy officer needs to draft an official position on an international matter in both English and Arabic, ensuring consistency with existing organizational positions, obtaining management approval through a formal chain, and publishing the finalized position for internal staff to reference when engaging with external stakeholders.

### Acceptance Scenarios

#### Position Drafting
1. **Given** I am a policy officer with drafting permissions, **When** I create a new position document with bilingual content (EN/AR), rationale, and alignment notes, **Then** the system saves my draft with provenance tracking showing me as the author.

2. **Given** I am drafting a position, **When** I select the audience groups that should have access to the position once published, **Then** the system records these access control settings with the position.

3. **Given** I am drafting a position, **When** I request AI assistance for initial text generation, **Then** the system provides bilingual draft content with citations to source materials.

4. **Given** I have a draft position, **When** I attach supporting documents, **Then** the system associates the attachments with the position and includes them in the approval package.

#### Approval Workflow
5. **Given** I have completed a draft position, **When** I submit it for review, **Then** the system transitions the status to "Under Review" and notifies the first approver in the chain.

6. **Given** I am an approver reviewing a submitted position, **When** I view the approval request, **Then** I can see the full content, rationale, attachments, and differences from previous versions.

7. **Given** I am an approver ready to approve a position, **When** I initiate approval, **Then** the system requires step-up authentication before recording my approval.

8. **Given** a position has passed through all approval stages, **When** the final approver signs off, **Then** the system marks the position as approved and ready for publication.

9. **Given** I am a reviewer who finds issues in a submitted position, **When** I add comments and request revisions, **Then** the system returns the position to the drafter with my feedback.

10. **Given** I am an approver who will be unavailable, **When** I delegate my approval authority to another user, **Then** the system records the delegation and transfers pending approvals to the delegate.

11. **Given** an approver has left the organization with pending approvals, **When** an administrator reassigns those approvals to a different user, **Then** the system updates the approval chain and notifies the new approver.

#### Versioning
12. **Given** a position has been approved, **When** I create a revised version, **Then** the system maintains the previous version and tracks the new version separately.

13. **Given** multiple versions of a position exist, **When** I compare versions, **Then** the system displays side-by-side differences highlighting changes in content.

14. **Given** a new version supersedes an older version, **When** I publish the new version, **Then** the system marks the old version as superseded while maintaining its history.

#### Publication
15. **Given** a position has been approved, **When** I publish it, **Then** the system makes it available only to the audience groups selected during drafting and records the publication date and publisher.

16. **Given** a position is published, **When** users within the authorized audience groups search for positions, **Then** they can discover it through faceted search by theme, status, date, or owner.

17. **Given** I am not in an authorized audience group for a position, **When** I search for positions, **Then** the system does not display that position in my search results.

#### Consistency Management
18. **Given** I am drafting a position, **When** I manually trigger a consistency check, **Then** the system identifies conflicts or contradictions with existing published positions.

19. **Given** I submit a position for review, **When** the system automatically runs consistency checks, **Then** any detected conflicts are displayed before proceeding to the approval chain.

20. **Given** consistency conflicts are detected, **When** I view the consistency panel, **Then** I see conflicting positions with suggested resolutions and alignment options.

21. **Given** I have resolved consistency conflicts, **When** I reconcile the conflicts in the system, **Then** the consistency score updates to reflect improved alignment.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when an approver in the chain is unavailable or leaves the organization? **Resolved**: Approvers can delegate authority, and administrators can reassign pending approvals (FR-018, FR-019).
- How does the system handle concurrent edits to the same position draft by multiple users? **Resolved**: Optimistic locking with version field (FR-009a to FR-009c) prevents conflicts with 409 response and manual merge option.
- What happens when a published position is found to contain errors after publication? **Resolved**: Emergency correction workflow (FR-053 to FR-058) allows admins to correct published positions with audit trail and audience notification.
- What happens when AI services are unavailable for drafting assistance or consistency checks? **Resolved**: System gracefully degrades, allowing manual operations to continue (FR-048).
- How are orphaned attachments handled if a position draft is deleted? **Resolved**: Cascade delete (FR-004a) removes attachments from storage and database when draft is permanently deleted.
- What happens if step-up authentication fails during the approval process? **Resolved**: 3-attempt retry with 15-min lockout (FR-012a to FR-012c), 10-min challenge expiry, bilingual error messages.

### Key Entities

- **Position**: Represents an official organizational stance or talking point on a specific matter. Contains bilingual content (English and Arabic), rationale, alignment notes, thematic classification, position type (which determines the 1-10 stage approval chain), selected audience groups (for access control post-publication), provenance information (author, dates), current status, and references to related positions. Associated with multiple versions, attachments, and consistency checks.

- **Version**: Represents a snapshot of a position at a specific point in time. Contains the full content as it existed at that version, timestamp, author of changes, version number, supersession status, and creation date (for 7-year retention tracking). Linked to the parent position and supports comparison with other versions. Versions are retained for 7 years from creation date to satisfy regulatory compliance requirements.

- **Approval**: Represents a single approval action within the approval chain. Contains approver identity (original or delegated/reassigned), timestamp, approval stage, comments, decision (approve/request revisions), authentication proof (step-up verification), and delegation/reassignment history if applicable. Linked to the position being approved.

- **Attachment**: Represents a supporting document associated with a position. Contains file metadata (name, size, type), upload date, uploader identity, and relationship to the position. Attached documents travel with the position through the approval process.

- **ConsistencyCheck**: Represents an analysis of alignment between positions. Contains consistency score, detected conflicts, identified contradictions, suggested resolutions, and reconciliation status. Links multiple positions that conflict or align with each other.

- **User**: Represents individuals who interact with the system in various roles (drafter, reviewer, approver, consumer). Contains identity information, role assignments, and permissions.

# Research: Specification Consistency Resolution

**Feature**: Resolve Theme System Specification Inconsistencies
**Date**: 2025-09-27

## Research Summary

No NEEDS CLARIFICATION items were found in the specification. All requirements are clear and focused on aligning existing documentation.

## Key Decisions

### 1. Performance Metric Standardization
**Decision**: Use "<100ms without page reload" as the unified performance target
**Rationale**: Provides measurable, testable criteria while maintaining user expectation of "immediate"
**Alternatives considered**:
- "Immediate" - Too vague, not measurable
- "No perceivable delay" - Subjective, varies by user
- "<50ms" - May be unnecessarily restrictive

### 2. Default Behavior Hierarchy
**Decision**: Stored preferences → System preferences → Application defaults
**Rationale**: Respects user choices first, falls back gracefully, ensures deterministic behavior
**Alternatives considered**:
- System preferences first - Would override user's explicit choices
- No system preference detection - Less user-friendly for new users
- Complex conditional logic - Would create ambiguity

### 3. Edge Case Handling Strategy
**Decision**: Convert all questions to concrete requirements with defined fallbacks
**Rationale**: Eliminates ambiguity, ensures consistent behavior, improves testability
**Alternatives considered**:
- Leave as implementation details - Creates inconsistency risk
- Remove edge cases - Would leave gaps in specification
- Defer to developer judgment - Reduces specification value

### 4. Terminology Alignment
**Decision**: Standardize on "shadcn/ui" throughout all documents
**Rationale**: Official package name, avoids confusion, maintains consistency
**Alternatives considered**:
- "shadcn" shorthand - Less precise
- "Shadcn UI" - Not the official format
- Mixed usage - Creates confusion

### 5. WCAG Compliance Specificity
**Decision**: Explicitly state WCAG 2.1 AA ratios (4.5:1 normal, 3:1 large)
**Rationale**: Provides clear, testable requirements, industry standard
**Alternatives considered**:
- "Good contrast" - Too subjective
- WCAG AAA - May be too restrictive
- Custom ratios - Not standard compliant

### 6. Dual Persistence Architecture
**Decision**: localStorage for immediate updates, Supabase for cross-device sync
**Rationale**: Optimal UX with instant feedback plus sync capabilities
**Alternatives considered**:
- Supabase only - Would have latency issues
- localStorage only - No cross-device sync
- Cookie storage - Size limitations

## Implementation Approach

Since this is a documentation-only update, the implementation will focus on:

1. **Direct edits** to existing specification files
2. **Validation scripts** to ensure consistency post-update
3. **Change tracking** to document what was modified
4. **Review process** to ensure no breaking changes

## Risk Assessment

### Low Risk
- Documentation changes only
- No code modifications required
- Backward compatible clarifications

### Mitigation
- Review all changes against existing implementation
- Ensure no new requirements that would break current code
- Maintain version history for rollback if needed

## Validation Strategy

1. **Cross-reference check**: Ensure all FR-XXX references are consistent
2. **Terminology scan**: Verify consistent use of terms across docs
3. **Metric alignment**: Confirm all performance numbers match
4. **Coverage analysis**: Verify no requirements lost in consolidation

## Dependencies

None - this is a documentation-only change that clarifies existing requirements.

## Next Steps

1. Generate data model for tracking specification relationships
2. Create validation contracts for consistency checks
3. Define quickstart validation checklist
4. Generate tasks for documentation updates

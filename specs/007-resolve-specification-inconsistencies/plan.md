# Implementation Plan: Resolve Theme System Specification Inconsistencies

**Branch**: `007-resolve-specification-inconsistencies` | **Date**: 2025-09-27 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/007-resolve-specification-inconsistencies/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → Feature spec loaded successfully
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detected Project Type: documentation update (no code implementation)
   → Set Structure Decision: N/A - documentation only
3. Fill the Constitution Check section
   → Checking bilingual, type safety, and documentation standards
4. Evaluate Constitution Check section
   → All constitutional requirements maintained
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check PASS
5. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → No NEEDS CLARIFICATION items found
6. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, CLAUDE.md
7. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → All requirements maintained
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check PASS
8. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach
9. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:
- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary
Resolve inconsistencies, duplications, and ambiguities in the theme selection system specifications to ensure clear, unambiguous implementation guidance. This involves updating three core documents (spec.md, plan.md, tasks.md) to align on performance targets, default behaviors, terminology, and edge case handling.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: TypeScript 5.0+, Node.js 18+
**Primary Dependencies**: Documentation updates only - no code dependencies
**Storage**: N/A - documentation changes only
**Testing**: Validation scripts to ensure consistency
**Target Platform**: Documentation in Markdown format
**Project Type**: documentation - specification alignment
**Performance Goals**: All specs reference <100ms theme switch target
**Constraints**: Must maintain backward compatibility with existing implementation
**Scale/Scope**: 3 specification documents, 12 functional requirements to align

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

### Accessibility ✅
- [x] WCAG 2.1 AA specific ratios documented
- [x] Keyboard navigation preserved
- [x] Screen reader requirements maintained

### Container-First ✅
- [x] No impact on containerization
- [x] Documentation changes only

### Source Code (repository root)

# Documentation updates only - affecting existing files:

├── spec.md              # Update performance targets, edge cases

**Structure Decision**: Documentation-only changes to existing feature files

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:
   - No NEEDS CLARIFICATION items found
   - All requirements are clear from analysis report

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:
   - Research: Best practices for documentation consistency
   - Research: Specification validation approaches
   - Research: Change tracking strategies

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
   - Decision: Performance metric standardization to <100ms
   - Rationale: Measurable, testable, industry standard
   - Alternatives considered: "immediate", "no delay", <50ms

**Output**: research.md with consistency approach confirmed

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
   - SpecificationDocument: tracks document versions and changes
   - Requirement: functional/non-functional requirements with metrics
   - Task: implementation tasks with requirement mappings
   - CrossReference: relationships between documents
   - Term: terminology tracking for consistency

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:
   - POST /validate/consistency - main validation endpoint
   - POST /validate/terminology - terminology check endpoint
   - POST /validate/coverage - requirement coverage endpoint
   - Output OpenAPI schema to `/contracts/validation.yaml`

3. **Generate contract tests** from contracts:
   - Validation endpoint tests (will fail initially)
   - Terminology consistency tests
   - Coverage analysis tests

4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories:
   - Scenario 1: Developer reads requirement with single interpretation
   - Scenario 2: Edge cases have defined behaviors
   - Scenario 3: Performance metrics are consistent
   - Quickstart validation steps documented

5. **Update agent file incrementally**:
   - Executed `.specify/scripts/bash/update-agent-context.sh claude`
   - Added documentation-only context
   - Preserved existing manual additions
   - Updated recent changes list

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/validation.yaml, quickstart.md, CLAUDE.md updated

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Generate documentation update tasks for each inconsistency
- Create validation script tasks
- Each requirement update → specific edit task
- Terminology standardization tasks [P]
- Edge case clarification tasks [P]
- Coverage verification tasks

**Ordering Strategy**:
- Critical fixes first (performance, defaults)
- Terminology updates second [P]
- Edge case updates third [P]
- Validation and verification last

**Estimated Output**: 15-20 numbered tasks for documentation updates

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)  
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)  
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking
*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |


## Progress Tracking
*This checklist is updated during execution flow*

**Phase Status**:
- [x] Phase 0: Research complete (/plan command)

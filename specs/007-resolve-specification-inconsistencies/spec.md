# Feature Specification: Resolve Theme System Specification Inconsistencies

**Feature Branch**: `007-resolve-specification-inconsistencies`
**Created**: 2025-09-27
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Resolve specification inconsistencies for theme selection system"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   → Resolve inconsistencies in theme system specifications
2. Extract key concepts from description
   → Identified: specification alignment, consistency fixes, clarifications
3. For each unclear aspect:
   → No critical clarifications needed - working from existing analysis
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   → Technical debt resolution and specification cleanup
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   → All requirements are clear and focused on consistency
6. Identify Key Entities
   → Specification documents and their relationships
7. Run Review Checklist
   → No blocking clarifications required
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ⚡ Quick Guidelines
- ✅ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ❌ Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- 👥 Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As a development team member, I need the theme selection system specifications to be internally consistent and unambiguous, so that implementation follows a single, clear set of requirements without conflicting guidance.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the theme system specifications exist across three documents, **When** a developer reads any requirement, **Then** there is only one clear interpretation with measurable criteria
2. **Given** edge cases are identified in the specification, **When** the system encounters these cases, **Then** the expected behavior is explicitly defined
3. **Given** default behavior is specified, **When** multiple defaults could apply, **Then** the priority order is clearly documented
4. **Given** performance requirements exist, **When** measured, **Then** all documents reference the same measurable targets
5. **Given** terminology is used across documents, **When** the same concept is referenced, **Then** the exact same term is used consistently

### Edge Cases
- When localStorage is unavailable, the system falls back to session storage then memory-only storage
- When modal dialogs are open during theme switch, the dialogs inherit the new theme immediately
- When forms contain unsaved data during language switch, a confirmation prompt appears before switching
- When slow connections delay theme loading, a loading indicator shows for operations taking >100ms

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST consolidate theme switch performance to a single measurable target of <100ms without page reload
- **FR-002**: System MUST define clear precedence: stored preferences override system preferences, which override application defaults
- **FR-003**: System MUST specify WCAG 2.1 AA contrast ratios (4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text) for all theme combinations
- **FR-004**: System MUST standardize terminology to use "shadcn/ui" consistently across all documentation
- **FR-005**: System MUST specify theme selector location as "persistent in application header/navigation bar"
- **FR-006**: System MUST include explicit font loading and configuration for Plus Jakarta Sans (GASTAT) and Open Sans (Blue Sky)
- **FR-007**: System MUST document dual persistence strategy with localStorage for immediate updates and Supabase for cross-device sync
- **FR-008**: System MUST convert edge case questions into concrete behavioral requirements with expected outcomes
- **FR-009**: System MUST align all task descriptions with actual deliverables (remove references to missing files)
- **FR-010**: System MUST maintain consistency between default behavior specifications across all documents
- **FR-011**: System MUST provide fallback behaviors for all identified edge cases
- **FR-012**: System MUST ensure all performance-related specifications use the same measurable metrics

### Key Entities
- **Specification Document**: Primary requirements document (spec.md) containing user-facing requirements and acceptance criteria
- **Implementation Plan**: Technical planning document (plan.md) containing architecture decisions and technical constraints
- **Task List**: Execution document (tasks.md) containing ordered implementation tasks with dependencies
- **Cross-Reference Map**: Relationships between requirements, plan items, and tasks ensuring complete coverage

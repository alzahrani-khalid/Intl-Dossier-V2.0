# Feature Specification: Security Enhancement and System Hardening

**Feature Branch**: `005-resolve-critical-items`  
**Created**: 2025-01-27  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "- Resolve CRITICAL items before implementation: - Add MFA, RLS, and encryption tasks + tests. - Add explicit autoscaling/alerting setup tasks. - Close HIGH gaps: - Add tasks for clustering, anomaly detection, search export, and CI coverage gate. - Add accessibility tasks and CI checks. - Suggested commands: - Refine spec: update spec.md to add NFR section and clarify FR-040."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   → If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   → Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   → Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   → If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   → Each requirement must be testable
   → Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   → If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   → If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ⚡ Quick Guidelines
- ✅ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ❌ Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- 👥 Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a system administrator and security officer, I need enhanced security measures, monitoring capabilities, and accessibility features to ensure the International Dossier System meets enterprise security standards, provides comprehensive system observability, and complies with accessibility requirements.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user accessing the system, **When** they attempt to log in, **Then** they must complete multi-factor authentication before gaining access
2. **Given** a database with sensitive data, **When** users query data, **Then** Row Level Security policies restrict access based on user permissions
3. **Given** sensitive data at rest, **When** data is stored, **Then** it must be encrypted using industry-standard encryption
4. **Given** system under varying load, **When** traffic increases beyond threshold, **Then** system automatically scales resources
5. **Given** system components running, **When** any component exhibits anomalous behavior, **Then** alerts are triggered and logged
6. **Given** a user with visual impairments, **When** they navigate the interface, **Then** screen readers can properly interpret all content
7. **Given** search results needing export, **When** user requests export, **Then** results can be exported in multiple formats
8. **Given** code changes submitted, **When** CI pipeline runs, **Then** test coverage must meet minimum threshold

### Edge Cases
- What happens when MFA service is temporarily unavailable? System falls back to backup codes only (no TOTP) during outage
- How does system handle RLS policy conflicts or overlapping permissions? Explicit deny always overrides any allow rules
- What occurs when encryption keys need rotation during active sessions? Sessions gracefully migrate to new keys on next request
- How does autoscaling behave during rapid traffic spikes or DDoS attempts?
- What happens when anomaly detection produces false positives? Sensitivity levels can be adjusted; false positives are logged for ML model refinement
- How are accessibility features maintained across different device types?
- What format limitations exist for search result exports?
- How does coverage gate handle partially tested modules?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

#### Security Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST implement multi-factor authentication for all user accounts
- **FR-002**: System MUST enforce MFA for privileged operations and administrative access

- **FR-004**: System MUST encrypt all sensitive data at rest. During key rotation, active sessions gracefully migrate to new keys on next request without disruption
- **FR-005**: System MUST encrypt all data in transit using TLS 1.3+. HSTS (includeSubDomains, max-age ≥ 31536000) enabled; cookies set Secure+HttpOnly with SameSite=Lax
- **FR-006**: System MUST log all authentication attempts and security events
- **FR-007**: System MUST support TOTP authenticator apps and 10 one-time backup recovery codes; bilingual enrollment and error messages; no SMS/email as primary factors. During TOTP service outages, system accepts only backup codes for authentication

#### Infrastructure & Monitoring Requirements
- **FR-008**: Autoscale on CPU>70% for 5 minutes OR memory>80% for 5 minutes; scale range min=2, max=20 instances. When max=20 reached, alert ops and degrade: (A) chart animations off, (B) search auto-suggest disabled, (C) report scheduling deferred
- **FR-009**: System MUST maintain service availability during scaling operations
- **FR-010**: Generate alerts for critical events within 60 seconds
- **FR-011**: System MUST detect anomalous patterns in user behavior and system performance using ML-based scoring with configurable sensitivity levels (low/medium/high/custom thresholds)
- **FR-012**: System MUST support database clustering for high availability
- **FR-013**: Send alerts to email and signed webhook; optional Slack/Teams. Alert summaries bilingual (ar/en)

#### Search & Export Requirements
- **FR-014**: System MUST allow users to export search results. Export preserves filters, column order, and locale formats; completes ≤30s for up to 100k rows; verified via schema snapshot tests
- **FR-015**: Export functionality MUST support CSV, JSON, and Excel formats at minimum
- **FR-016**: Exported data MUST respect user's data access permissions

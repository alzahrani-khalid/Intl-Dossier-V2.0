# Specification Quality Checklist: Unified Tasks Model

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-01-19
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

✅ **ALL CHECKS PASSED**

The specification is complete and ready for planning phase.

### Validation Summary:
- **User Scenarios**: 5 prioritized user stories with clear acceptance criteria
- **Functional Requirements**: 20 detailed requirements covering all aspects
- **Success Criteria**: 8 measurable outcomes (technology-agnostic)
- **Edge Cases**: 7 edge cases identified and addressed
- **Scope**: Clearly defined with in-scope and out-of-scope items
- **No Clarifications Needed**: All requirements are specific and unambiguous

### Next Steps:
1. ✅ Specification is approved for planning
2. Run `/speckit.plan` to generate implementation plan
3. Run `/speckit.tasks` to generate actionable task breakdown

## Notes

- Specification successfully merges the concept of assignments and tasks into a unified model
- Clear distinction maintained between tasks (work to be done) and work items (entities being worked on)
- Contributors feature enables team collaboration tracking
- Engagement context properly preserved for kanban functionality
- All UX issues (showing IDs instead of titles) are addressed
- Migration strategy includes safety measures (30-day rollback window)

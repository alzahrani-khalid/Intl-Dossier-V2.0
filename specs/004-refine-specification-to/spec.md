## Clarifications

### Session 2025-09-27
- Q: When the vector embedding service fails during document processing, how should the system handle the document? ‚Üí A: Store document without embeddings, mark for later processing
- Q: How should the system handle rate limit violations from anonymous (non-authenticated) users? ‚Üí A: Block by IP address with stricter limits (50 req/min)
- Q: When auto-scaling reaches the maximum configured instances (20) and load continues to increase, what should happen? ‚Üí A: Alert ops team and degrade non-critical features
- Q: What is the default retention period for intelligence reports in the system? ‚Üí A: 90 days active, then archive for 7 years
- Q: When some search filters timeout during complex queries, how should the system handle partial results? ‚Üí A: Return partial results with warning indicator

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As a system administrator, I need clear and unambiguous system requirements so that the development team can implement features correctly without assumptions, ensuring consistent behavior across all modules.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the AI integration module, **When** AnythingLLM is unavailable, **Then** the system continues to function with predefined fallback behaviors without data loss
2. **Given** multiple concurrent users, **When** each user makes 300 requests within a minute, **Then** the system enforces rate limits per individual user without affecting other users
3. **Given** system load increases, **When** it reaches 80% of defined capacity, **Then** the system triggers auto-scaling to maintain performance
4. **Given** a user searches for dossiers, **When** they apply multiple filters, **Then** results are returned within 2 seconds for datasets up to 100,000 records
5. **Given** a report generation request, **When** export format is selected, **Then** the system produces the report in PDF, Excel, or CSV format
6. **Given** different browsers, **When** users access the system, **Then** all features function correctly in Chrome 90+, Firefox 88+, Safari 14+, and Edge 90+

### Edge Cases
- When vector embedding service fails during document processing, the system stores the document without embeddings and marks it for later processing
- Anonymous users are rate-limited by IP address with stricter limits (50 requests/minute) compared to authenticated users
- When auto-scaling reaches maximum configured instances (20), the system alerts the ops team and degrades non-critical features to maintain core functionality
- When some search filters timeout, the system returns partial results with a warning indicator showing which filters could not be applied

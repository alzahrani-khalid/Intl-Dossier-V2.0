# Research: System Requirements Refinement and Clarification

**Feature**: 004-refine-specification-to
**Date**: 2025-09-27
**Status**: Complete

## Executive Summary
This research document consolidates technical decisions and architectural patterns for implementing the refined system requirements. All technical unknowns have been resolved through analysis of the constitution, existing codebase patterns, and industry best practices.

## Research Findings

### 1. AI/ML Implementation Strategy

**Decision**: K-means clustering via scikit-learn with pgvector integration
**Rationale**: 
- Native PostgreSQL integration through pgvector
- Proven scalability for 1536-dimensional embeddings
- Configurable cluster count (3-10) as specified
**Alternatives Considered**:
- DBSCAN: Rejected due to unpredictable cluster counts
- Hierarchical clustering: Too computationally expensive at scale

### 2. Anomaly Detection Architecture

**Decision**: Isolation Forest with contamination=0.1
**Rationale**:
- Handles high-dimensional data efficiently
- Works well with intelligence report patterns
- Contamination parameter aligns with expected anomaly rate
**Alternatives Considered**:
- One-Class SVM: Higher computational cost
- Local Outlier Factor: Requires k-neighbors, less efficient

### 3. Rate Limiting Implementation

**Decision**: Token bucket algorithm with Redis backing
**Rationale**:
- Supports burst capacity (50 requests)
- Per-user and per-IP tracking capabilities
- Integrates with Supabase via edge functions
**Alternatives Considered**:
- Sliding window: More complex, minimal benefit
- Fixed window: Doesn't handle bursts well

### 4. Vector Storage Optimization

**Decision**: HNSW indexing with ef_construction=200, m=16
**Rationale**:
- Optimal for cosine similarity searches
- Balance between build time and query performance
- Proven configuration for 1536-dimensional vectors
**Alternatives Considered**:
- IVF indexes: Lower recall at similar performance
- Brute force: Not scalable beyond 10k vectors

### 5. Horizontal Scaling Triggers

**Decision**: Kubernetes HPA with custom metrics
**Rationale**:
- CPU threshold: 70% for 5 minutes (prevents flapping)
- Memory threshold: 80% for 5 minutes
- Supports 2-20 instance range
**Alternatives Considered**:
- AWS Auto Scaling: Vendor lock-in concern
- Manual scaling: Not responsive enough

### 6. Session Affinity Strategy

**Decision**: Cookie-based sticky sessions with 30-minute TTL
**Rationale**:
- Maintains user context during scaling
- Works with Traefik load balancer
- Graceful failover on instance termination
**Alternatives Considered**:
- IP hash: Breaks with mobile users changing networks
- Server-side session store: Added latency

### 7. Fallback Mechanism Design

**Decision**: Three-tier fallback system
**Rationale**:
1. Primary: AnythingLLM with embeddings
2. Secondary: Keyword-based search (BM25)
3. Tertiary: Cached results with "offline" indicator
**Alternatives Considered**:
- Single fallback: Insufficient resilience
- No fallback: Violates constitution principles

### 8. Archive Storage Strategy

**Decision**: Partitioned tables with compression
**Rationale**:
- 90-day active partition (hot data)
- 7-year archive partition (compressed)
- Transparent access via views
**Alternatives Considered**:
- S3 archival: Complicates queries
- Separate archive DB: Maintenance overhead

### 9. Browser Compatibility Testing

**Decision**: Playwright with BrowserStack integration
**Rationale**:
- Covers Chrome 90+, Firefox 88+, Safari 14+, Edge 90+
- Automated cross-browser testing
- Visual regression testing support
**Alternatives Considered**:
- Manual testing: Not scalable
- Selenium Grid: Higher maintenance

### 10. Partial Result Handling

**Decision**: Progressive rendering with status indicators
**Rationale**:
- Returns available results immediately
- Shows which filters are pending/failed
- Maintains perceived performance
**Alternatives Considered**:
- Wait for all: Poor user experience
- Cancel on timeout: Loss of partial data

## Implementation Priorities

1. **Critical Path** (Week 1):
   - Rate limiting infrastructure
   - Vector storage setup
   - Basic fallback mechanisms

2. **Core Features** (Week 2-3):
   - K-means clustering
   - Anomaly detection
   - Search with filters

3. **Scaling & Performance** (Week 4):
   - Horizontal scaling setup
   - Session affinity
   - Archive partitioning

4. **Polish** (Week 5):
   - Browser compatibility
   - Performance optimization
   - Monitoring & alerts

## Risk Mitigation

| Risk | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|-------------------|
| Vector search performance degradation | Pre-compute embeddings, use materialized views |
| Rate limit bypass attempts | IP-based blocking, CAPTCHA escalation |
| Scaling limit reached | Alert ops team, degrade non-critical features |
| Archive query performance | Indexed views, query result caching |
| Browser incompatibility | Progressive enhancement, polyfills |

## Compliance Notes

- All decisions align with Constitution v2.1.1
- Bilingual support considered in all UI components
- Security-first approach maintained throughout
- Data sovereignty requirements met (self-hosted)
- Accessibility standards (WCAG 2.1 AA) incorporated

## Conclusion

All technical unknowns have been resolved. The architecture supports the 46+ functional requirements while maintaining constitutional compliance. The implementation can proceed with Phase 1 (Design & Contracts) using these research findings as the technical foundation.

# Specification Quality Checklist: Complete Mobile Development to Match Web Progress

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-12
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
  - ✓ Specification describes features in terms of user value (intake submissions, search, user management, assignments, Kanban, relationships)
  - ✓ No mention of React Native, Expo, WatermelonDB, or implementation specifics in requirements
  - ✓ Success criteria focus on user outcomes (completion time, performance, adoption) not technical metrics

- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
  - ✓ All user stories clearly articulate "Why this priority" explaining business value
  - ✓ Independent tests demonstrate deliverable user value for each story
  - ✓ Success criteria measure business outcomes (60% faster intake submission, 70% field staff adoption, NPS ≥40)

- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
  - ✓ Plain language throughout (no jargon like "API endpoints", "database schema", "component lifecycle")
  - ✓ User scenarios describe workflows in business terms (field staff, supervisors, HR administrators)
  - ✓ Technical constraints explained in user-facing terms (offline access, sync behavior, notification delivery)

- [x] All mandatory sections completed
  - ✓ User Scenarios & Testing: 6 prioritized user stories with acceptance scenarios
  - ✓ Edge Cases: 12 edge cases across all feature areas with clear resolution
  - ✓ Mobile Requirements: Offline behavior, native features, performance criteria all defined
  - ✓ Requirements: 42 functional requirements covering all user stories
  - ✓ Key Entities: 8 mobile-specific entities identified
  - ✓ Success Criteria: 25 measurable outcomes across parity, performance, offline, UX, reliability, and adoption

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
  - ✓ All requirements are fully specified without ambiguity
  - ✓ No placeholders or TBD items in functional requirements
  - ✓ Edge cases have definitive resolution strategies
  - ✓ Performance targets are specific with measurement criteria

- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
  - ✓ Every FR has clear success/failure criteria (e.g., FR-003 "AI triage within 2 seconds", FR-006 "suggestions ≤200ms")
  - ✓ No vague terms like "fast", "good", "reasonable" - all use specific metrics
  - ✓ User scenarios follow Given-When-Then format for testability
  - ✓ Edge cases specify exact system behavior with no ambiguity

- [x] Success criteria are measurable
  - ✓ All SC have quantitative metrics: ≥95% parity score, ≤1s render time, ≥99.5% crash-free rate
  - ✓ Performance targets specify device baseline (iPhone 12/Pixel 5), network (4G), and timing (≤200ms, ≤3s)
  - ✓ User adoption metrics specify percentages and timeframes (70% within 30 days, 85% within first week)
  - ✓ Quality metrics have thresholds (≥98% conflict resolution, ≥95% notification delivery)

- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic
  - ✓ No mention of frameworks (React Native, Expo), databases (WatermelonDB), or libraries
  - ✓ Metrics describe user-facing outcomes (render time, sync completion, notification delivery) not system internals
  - ✓ Performance criteria specify user experience (60fps animations, smooth gestures) not technical implementation
  - ✓ All SC could be verified without knowing implementation details

- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
  - ✓ Each of 6 user stories has 5-7 acceptance scenarios covering happy path and variations
  - ✓ Mobile-specific scenarios included (offline behavior, RTL layout, portrait/landscape, touch gestures)
  - ✓ All scenarios follow Given-When-Then format with clear expected outcomes
  - ✓ Cross-platform considerations addressed (iOS/Android permission flows, haptic feedback, biometrics)

- [x] Edge cases are identified
  - ✓ 12 edge cases documented covering all major features
  - ✓ Each edge case has specific resolution strategy (not "to be determined")
  - ✓ Mobile-specific edge cases addressed (connectivity loss, permission denial, gesture conflicts, large datasets)
  - ✓ Conflict scenarios defined with clear precedence rules (server wins for roles, last-write-wins for Kanban)

- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
  - ✓ Platform scope explicit: "mobile-only" completing parity with web
  - ✓ Out of Scope section lists 15 excluded features with clear rationale
  - ✓ User stories prioritized (P1/P2/P3) indicating implementation order
  - ✓ Dependencies section identifies what must exist before mobile development can proceed

- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified
  - ✓ Assumptions section: 12 items covering backend APIs, infrastructure, device capabilities, deployment
  - ✓ Dependencies section: 13 items covering backend compatibility, sync protocols, native features, libraries
  - ✓ All dependencies are external (backend, services, platforms) not internal implementation details
  - ✓ Assumptions are reasonable and documented for validation

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
  - ✓ Every FR includes measurable success criteria (e.g., FR-003 "within 2 seconds", FR-006 "≤200ms")
  - ✓ Mobile-specific requirements include device targets (iPhone 12/Pixel 5, 44x44px touch targets)
  - ✓ Offline requirements specify exact sync behavior (5s incremental, 15min background, pull-to-refresh)
  - ✓ Platform requirements detail iOS/Android differences (permission flows, share extensions, biometrics)

- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
  - ✓ All 6 user stories represent complete end-to-end workflows (intake submission, search, role management, SLA tracking, Kanban updates, relationship viewing)
  - ✓ Priority distribution appropriate: 3 P1 (critical operations), 2 P2 (important but not blocking), 1 P3 (reference/lookup)
  - ✓ Each story independently testable with defined value delivery
  - ✓ Mobile-specific flows addressed (offline-first, touch gestures, native features, orientation changes)

- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
  - ✓ SC-001: 100% web feature parity explicitly mapped to 6 user stories covering all web modules
  - ✓ SC-004-009: Performance targets align with mobile-specific requirements (1s render, 200ms suggestions, 3s Kanban, 2s graph)
  - ✓ SC-010-012: Offline capability matches offline behavior requirements (7 days, 95% sync success, 98% conflict resolution)
  - ✓ SC-013-017: UX targets support usability requirements (5min first intake, 100% touch compliance, 80% biometric adoption)
  - ✓ SC-018-021: Reliability targets ensure production quality (99.5% crash-free, 95% notification delivery, <10% performance degradation)
  - ✓ SC-022-025: Adoption metrics validate business case (70% field staff usage, NPS ≥40, 60% faster submission, 85% multi-workflow completion)

- [x] No implementation details leak into specification
  - ✓ No code snippets, API definitions, or database schemas in spec
  - ✓ Libraries mentioned only in Dependencies section as external constraints (React Native Paper, WatermelonDB, Expo modules)
  - ✓ Technical architecture details (WatermelonDB schema, Supabase Realtime channels) properly scoped to Dependencies
  - ✓ All requirements describe "what" and "why" not "how"

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

- Q: What are the search performance targets by type? ‚Üí A: Simple keyword search <500ms, faceted search <1s, AI-powered semantic search <3s
- Q: How should data archival work? ‚Üí A: Run monthly, moving inactive records older than 2 years to archive storage while maintaining searchability

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As an International Relations professional at GASTAT, I need a comprehensive AI-powered system to manage all international relationships, track commitments, prepare for engagements, and gain strategic insights, so that I can optimize GASTAT's international cooperation efforts and ensure all obligations are met efficiently.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** I have an international meeting with UN Statistics Division tomorrow, **When** I request a brief for the meeting, **Then** the system generates a comprehensive brief within 30 seconds containing historical interactions, current commitments, key contacts, agenda items, recommended talking points, and relevant position papers in my preferred language (Arabic or English).

2. **Given** a new MoU has been signed with a partner country, **When** I enter the agreement details with milestones and deliverables, **Then** the system tracks each deliverable with status indicators, sends automated reminders at 30, 60, and 90 days before deadlines, escalates overdue items to management, and calculates performance metrics.

3. **Given** I need to coordinate multiple international events in Q1, **When** I access the events dashboard, **Then** I see all events with participation status, delegation compositions, budget allocations, required preparations, potential conflicts, and ROI projections in a unified calendar view.

4. **Given** executive leadership requests a partnership overview, **When** they access the executive dashboard, **Then** they see a global engagement heatmap, relationship health scores (0-100), commitment completion rates, risk indicators, and AI-generated weekly intelligence digests customized to their role.

5. **Given** I'm researching international best practices in digital transformation, **When** I search the knowledge base, **Then** the system provides relevant documents from peer NSOs, expert contacts, innovation trends, benchmarking comparisons, and implementation examples with source attribution.

6. **Given** I need to track all bilateral relationships with GCC countries, **When** I filter dossiers by region, **Then** I see comprehensive profiles for each country including statistical system overviews, cooperation areas, active projects, key contacts, and relationship health metrics with drill-down capabilities.

7. **Given** a delegation needs preparation for an OECD committee meeting, **When** I generate a policy pack, **Then** the system compiles relevant GASTAT positions, checks for consistency, identifies potential conflicts with national strategies, and suggests responses based on precedent.

8. **Given** I'm monitoring international statistical developments, **When** I access the foresight module, **Then** I see emerging trends, partnership opportunities, competitive intelligence about peer NSOs, and risk alerts with recommended actions.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when MoU expiration approaches without a renewal decision?
- How does the system handle scheduling conflicts when key personnel are required at multiple international events?
- What occurs when commitment deadlines conflict with changed national priorities?
- How are highly sensitive diplomatic communications protected and access-controlled?
- What happens when external organization APIs are unavailable or return inconsistent data?
- How does the system maintain service when AI capabilities are temporarily unavailable?
- What happens when duplicate dossiers are detected? System warns at 80%+ similarity, shows comparison, allows override with justification
- How does the system handle multi-party agreements versus bilateral ones?
- What occurs when historical data migration contains incomplete or corrupted records?
- How are conflicting positions identified when multiple departments provide input?

2. **AI Integration**: Central to many features - brief generation, insights, recommendations
3. **Real-time Collaboration**: Multiple users working on same dossiers simultaneously
4. **Offline Capability**: Mobile apps must function without connectivity
5. **Compliance Focus**: Saudi regulations (NCA, SDAIA) drive security architecture
6. **Performance Targets**: Specific SLAs for response times and availability
7. **Integration Scope**: Must connect with internal GASTAT systems and external organization APIs

### Recent Enhancements (2025-09-26)

Following the `/analyze` command gap analysis, the specification has been enhanced with:
- **Position Management**: Added inconsistency detection, reconciliation workflow, and consistency scoring (FR-036-038)
- **Permission Delegation**: Complete temporary delegation system with audit trails (FR-079-082)
- **Digital Signatures**: Full MoU signing workflow with DocuSign/PKI support (FR-019-022)

# Implementation Plan: GASTAT International Dossier System

**Branch**: `001-project-docs-gastat` | **Date**: 2025-09-26 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-project-docs-gastat/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Fill the Constitution Check section based on the content of the constitution document.
4. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
5. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
6. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file (e.g., `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for GitHub Copilot, `GEMINI.md` for Gemini CLI, `QWEN.md` for Qwen Code or `AGENTS.md` for opencode).
7. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
8. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
9. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:
- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary
Building a comprehensive AI-powered international dossier management system for GASTAT to optimize international cooperation efforts. The system manages relationships, tracks commitments, prepares engagement briefs, and provides strategic intelligence insights. Core capabilities include bilingual support (Arabic/English), real-time collaboration, offline mobile access, and self-hosted AI integration using AnythingLLM.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: TypeScript 5.0+, Node.js 20 LTS
**Primary Dependencies**: React 18+, Supabase 2.0+, TanStack Router/Query v5, AnythingLLM (self-hosted)
**Storage**: PostgreSQL 15 with pgvector, Supabase Storage for documents
**Testing**: Vitest for unit/integration, Playwright for E2E
**Target Platform**: Web browsers (Chrome/Edge/Safari/Firefox), iOS/Android native apps
**Project Type**: web (frontend+backend+mobile)
**Performance Goals**: <500ms simple search, <1s faceted search, <3s AI search, <30s AI brief generation
**Constraints**: 99.9% uptime business hours, 500 concurrent users, WCAG 2.1 AA compliance, offline mobile capability
**Scale/Scope**: ~500 users, 98 functional requirements, 19 entity types, 3 platforms (web/iOS/Android)

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

✅ **Bilingual Parity**: All requirements specify Arabic/English support from day one (FR-051, FR-097)
✅ **Type Safety**: TypeScript 5.0+ with strict mode specified in Technical Context
✅ **Security-First**: MFA (FR-074), RLS enforcement, encryption (FR-083), access control (FR-075-077)
✅ **Data Sovereignty**: Self-hosted AnythingLLM, containerized deployment, no cloud dependencies
✅ **Resilient Architecture**: Error handling specified, offline capabilities (FR-091-096), AI fallbacks
✅ **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance explicitly required (FR-098)
✅ **Container-First**: Docker deployment specified in constitution, health checks planned

**Assessment**: Feature aligns with all constitutional principles. No violations detected.

# Option 3: Mobile + API (when "iOS/Android" detected)

└── [platform-specific structure]
```

**Structure Decision**: Option 2 (Web application) + Mobile - based on web frontend/backend + native mobile apps requirement

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:
   - For each NEEDS CLARIFICATION → research task
   - For each dependency → best practices task
   - For each integration → patterns task

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:
   ```
   For each unknown in Technical Context:
     Task: "Research {unknown} for {feature context}"
   For each technology choice:
     Task: "Find best practices for {tech} in {domain}"
   ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
   - Decision: [what was chosen]
   - Rationale: [why chosen]
   - Alternatives considered: [what else evaluated]

**Output**: research.md with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
   - Entity name, fields, relationships
   - Validation rules from requirements
   - State transitions if applicable

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:
   - For each user action → endpoint
   - Use standard REST/GraphQL patterns
   - Output OpenAPI/GraphQL schema to `/contracts/`

3. **Generate contract tests** from contracts:
   - One test file per endpoint
   - Assert request/response schemas
   - Tests must fail (no implementation yet)

4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories:
   - Each story → integration test scenario
   - Quickstart test = story validation steps

5. **Update agent file incrementally** (O(1) operation):
   - Run `.specify/scripts/bash/update-agent-context.sh claude`
     **IMPORTANT**: Execute it exactly as specified above. Do not add or remove any arguments.
   - If exists: Add only NEW tech from current plan
   - Preserve manual additions between markers
   - Update recent changes (keep last 3)
   - Keep under 150 lines for token efficiency
   - Output to repository root

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, failing tests, quickstart.md, agent-specific file

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Load `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` as base
- Generate tasks from Phase 1 design docs (contracts, data model, quickstart)
- Each contract → contract test task [P]
- Each entity → model creation task [P] 
- Each user story → integration test task
- Implementation tasks to make tests pass

**Ordering Strategy**:
- TDD order: Tests before implementation 
- Dependency order: Models before services before UI
- Mark [P] for parallel execution (independent files)

**Estimated Output**: 25-30 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)  
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)  
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking
*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |


## Progress Tracking
*This checklist is updated during execution flow*

**Phase Status**:
- [x] Phase 0: Research complete (/plan command)
- [x] Phase 1: Design complete (/plan command)
- [x] Phase 2: Task planning complete (/plan command - describe approach only)
- [x] Phase 3: Tasks generated (/tasks command)

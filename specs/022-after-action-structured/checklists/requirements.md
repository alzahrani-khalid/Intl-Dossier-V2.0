# Specification Quality Checklist: After-Action Structured Documentation

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-01-14
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Notes

### Initial Validation (2025-01-14)

**Status**: ✅ PASSED

All checklist items passed on first review. The specification:

1. **Content Quality**: Clean separation between WHAT (user needs) and HOW (implementation). All sections focus on user value and business outcomes.

2. **Requirements**: All 25 functional requirements are testable and unambiguous with concrete acceptance criteria. No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers present - all potential ambiguities were resolved using informed defaults documented in Assumptions section.

3. **Success Criteria**: All 13 criteria are measurable and technology-agnostic:
   - SC-001 to SC-010: Quantitative metrics (time, percentage, rate, size)
   - SC-011 to SC-013: Qualitative metrics (satisfaction, adoption, time reduction)
   - No mention of implementation details or technology choices

4. **User Scenarios**: 5 prioritized user stories (P1 to P3) with:
   - Clear independent testing capability
   - Priority justification for each story
   - Complete acceptance scenarios
   - Mobile-specific scenarios where applicable

5. **Edge Cases**: 9 comprehensive edge cases covered with documented resolution strategies

6. **Scope**: Clear boundaries with comprehensive Out of Scope section (10 items) preventing scope creep

7. **Dependencies**: 11 dependencies identified with specific integration points

8. **Assumptions**: 11 assumptions documented to provide context for technical decisions during planning

### Key Clarification Decisions

The following decisions were made using informed defaults (documented in spec):

1. **Translation Service**: Listed in Dependencies with open question "or manual translation assumed?" - left as planning-phase decision since both approaches are viable and don't impact feature scope
2. **Performance Thresholds**: Used industry-standard web/mobile performance expectations (1-3s for most operations)
3. **AI Confidence Threshold**: Set at 0.7 based on common ML practice for human-in-the-loop systems
4. **File Size Limits**: Set at 100MB per file (industry standard for document management systems)
5. **Notification Timing**: 24 hours before due date (standard practice for task management)

### Readiness Assessment

✅ **Ready for `/speckit.plan`**: All quality criteria met, no clarifications needed, comprehensive coverage of user scenarios and requirements.

The specification provides sufficient detail for:
- Technical planning and architecture design
- Task breakdown and estimation
- API contract definition
- Database schema design
- Test plan creation

No additional clarification required before proceeding to planning phase.

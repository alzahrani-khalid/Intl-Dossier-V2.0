## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

1. **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - start immediately
2. **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
3. **User Stories (Phases 3-7)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
   - User Story 1 (Phase 3 - P1): No dependencies on other stories
   - User Story 2 (Phase 4 - P2): No dependencies on other stories (independent)
   - User Story 3 (Phase 5 - P2): No dependencies on other stories (independent)
   - User Story 4 (Phase 6 - P3): Builds on US1 (requires publish workflow) but independently testable
   - User Story 5 (Phase 7 - P3): Builds on US1 (requires commitment creation) but independently testable
4. **Mobile E2E Tests (Phase 8)**: Depends on US1-US2 mobile implementations
5. **Performance & Accessibility (Phase 9)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete
6. **Polish (Phase 10)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Independence

- **US1 (Quick After-Action Creation)**: Foundational story - all others build on this
- **US2 (AI-Assisted Data Entry)**: Independent - can be implemented without US3/US4/US5
- **US3 (Bilingual PDFs)**: Independent - can be implemented without US2/US4/US5
- **US4 (Edit Workflow)**: Depends on US1 publish workflow, but independently testable
- **US5 (External Contacts)**: Depends on US1 commitment creation, but independently testable

### Parallel Opportunities

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: All tasks marked [P] run in parallel (T001-T007)
- **Foundational Database (Phase 2)**: T008-T018 sequential (migrations apply in order), T019-T024 after migrations complete
- **Foundational Types (Phase 2)**: T021-T024 [P] run in parallel after T020 (type generation)
- **Foundational Mobile (Phase 2)**: T025-T036 mixed (schemas [P], services sequential on schemas)
- **Once Foundational complete**: All user stories can START in parallel (if team capacity)
- **Within each user story**:
  - All contract tests [P] run together
  - All integration tests [P] run together
  - All E2E tests [P] run together
  - All component tests [P] run together
  - Backend implementations sequential (dependencies on services)
  - Frontend components [P] run together (different files)
  - Mobile components [P] run together (different files)

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup (T001-T007)
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (T008-T036) - CRITICAL blocking phase
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (T037-T083)
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test US1 independently - users can create after-actions, auto-create tasks, view in dossier timeline
5. Deploy/demo if ready - this is the **minimum viable product**

**Timeline**: ~3-4 weeks for MVP (1 developer)

### Incremental Delivery

1. **Foundation** (Phases 1-2): Setup + Database + Types + Mobile Infrastructure ‚Üí Foundation ready
2. **US1** (Phase 3): After-action creation + task auto-creation ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (MVP!)
3. **US2** (Phase 4): AI extraction ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (time savings demonstrated)
4. **US3** (Phase 5): Bilingual PDFs ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (distribution capability added)
5. **US4** (Phase 6): Edit workflow ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (governance satisfied)
6. **US5** (Phase 7): External contacts ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (mixed meetings supported)
7. **Polish** (Phases 8-10): Mobile E2E + Performance + Final polish ‚Üí Full release

**Timeline**: ~6-8 weeks for full implementation (2 developers in parallel)

### Parallel Team Strategy (2 Developers)

**Week 1-2: Foundation (Together)**
- Both developers: Complete Setup (Phase 1) + Foundational (Phase 2)
- Pairing on database schema, RLS policies, mobile setup

**Week 3-4: US1 + US2 (Parallel)**
- Developer A: User Story 1 (after-action creation) - backend + frontend + mobile
- Developer B: User Story 2 (AI extraction) - backend + frontend + mobile
- Both stories can proceed in parallel after foundation

**Week 5: US3 + US4 (Parallel)**
- Developer A: User Story 3 (bilingual PDFs)
- Developer B: User Story 4 (edit workflow)

**Week 6: US5 + Integration (Parallel)**
- Developer A: User Story 5 (external contacts)
- Developer B: Mobile E2E tests (Phase 8)

**Week 7-8: Polish & Release**
- Both developers: Performance testing (Phase 9), final polish (Phase 10), quickstart validation

- Team can work in parallel after foundational phase
- All tests written first (TDD approach)
- Constitution compliance verified (mobile-first, RTL, test-first, security, accessibility)

## Next Steps

1. Review tasks.md with team
2. Prioritize: Start with MVP (US1) or full feature (US1-US5)?
3. Assign developers to phases/stories
4. Begin Phase 1: Setup
5. Proceed to Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - must complete before user stories)
6. Start user story implementation in priority order or parallel (based on team capacity)
7. Test each story independently before moving to next
8. Deploy incrementally as stories complete

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
**As a** Country Analyst managing international relationships,
**I want** to navigate seamlessly between related dossiers, work items, and documents,
**So that** I can maintain a comprehensive view of all relationships and activities without losing context.

### Acceptance Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: Country Analyst Managing Relationships
1. **Given** I am viewing the Saudi Arabia country dossier
   **When** I click on the Relationships tab
   **Then** I see a network graph showing connections to World Bank, IMF, G20, OPEC, and WTO dossiers
   **And** I can click any connected dossier to navigate directly to it
   **And** the relationship type and strength are clearly indicated

2. **Given** I am viewing a related organization dossier (e.g., World Bank)
   **When** I look at shared engagements
   **Then** I see all meetings that involve both Saudi Arabia and World Bank
   **And** I can navigate back to the Saudi Arabia dossier in 2 clicks or less

#### Scenario 2: Intake Officer Processing Requests
1. **Given** I receive a new request for data sharing agreement with UK
   **When** AI triage suggests it's an MoU for the United Kingdom dossier
   **Then** I can review the classification and confirm or override
   **And** upon conversion, the MoU is automatically linked to the UK dossier
   **And** the work item is auto-assigned to staff with legal review skills

2. **Given** a ticket is successfully converted to an MoU
   **When** I navigate to the UK dossier
   **Then** I see the new MoU listed in the MoUs tab
   **And** the timeline shows the creation event

#### Scenario 3: Policy Officer Creating Multi-Dossier Position
1. **Given** I am drafting a general data privacy position
   **When** I select to link it to all EU country dossiers, OECD, and Data Protection Forum
   **Then** the position appears in the Positions tab of all selected dossiers
   **And** when creating an engagement with any EU country, this position is suggested for attachment

2. **Given** I update a multi-dossier position
   **When** the changes are saved
   **Then** all linked dossiers reflect the updated content
   **And** users viewing any linked dossier see the latest version

#### Scenario 4: Staff Member Working on Assignments
1. **Given** I have multiple assignments in my queue
   **When** I view my assignments kanban board
   **Then** I see cards organized by status (Assigned, In Progress, Under Review)
   **And** each card shows the parent dossier context
   **And** SLA countdown is visible with color-coded urgency (green, yellow, red)

2. **Given** an assignment is nearing its SLA deadline
   **When** I view my assignments
   **Then** the card is highlighted in red with time remaining
   **And** the assignment appears at the top of its status column

#### Scenario 5: Creating Calendar Events
1. **Given** I need to schedule an event
   **When** I click "Create Event"
   **Then** I am asked whether this is an engagement with external parties
   **And** if YES, I am required to link to a dossier
   **And** if NO, dossier linking is optional

2. **Given** I create an engagement (external event)
   **When** the engagement is saved
   **Then** it appears in the calendar with blue color coding
   **And** it appears in the linked dossier's Engagements tab
   **And** it appears in the dossier's timeline
   **And** an after-action template is automatically created

3. **Given** I create an internal calendar entry
   **When** the entry is saved
   **Then** it appears in the calendar with green color coding
   **And** if linked to a dossier, it appears in that dossier's timeline

### Edge Cases
- **What happens when** a dossier is archived while it has active relationships?
  ‚Üí Related dossiers show the relationship as "archived" but maintain the link for historical context

- **What happens when** a position is deleted that's linked to multiple dossiers?
  ‚Üí System warns user of all impacted dossiers and requires confirmation

- **What happens when** a user tries to create a circular dossier relationship?
  ‚Üí System prevents self-referencing relationships and validates against circular dependencies

- **What happens when** an engagement is rescheduled via calendar drag-and-drop?
  ‚Üí Engagement date updates, affected dossier timelines update, and participants receive notifications

- **What happens when** a document is uploaded to an entity that gets deleted?
  ‚Üí Documents are soft-deleted with the entity, preservable for audit/compliance

- **How does system handle** searching for documents across multiple entity types?
  ‚Üí Polymorphic document search returns results from all entity types with clear source indication

- **How does system handle** concurrent updates to dossier relationships?
  ‚Üí Optimistic locking prevents conflicts; users are notified of concurrent changes

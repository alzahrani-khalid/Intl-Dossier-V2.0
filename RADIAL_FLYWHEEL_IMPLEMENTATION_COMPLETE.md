**Date**: 2025-10-09
**Status**: ✅ **Production Ready**
**Feature**: Entity Relationships Radial Flywheel Design (Feature 017 Enhancement)

---

## 📋 Summary

Successfully redesigned the React Flow relationship graph from compact nodes to a sophisticated **radial flywheel layout** with large card-style nodes, dotted connection lines, and impact badges matching the reference design.

## ✅ What Was Requested

User provided a reference image showing a business impact diagram with:
- Central hub with detailed card design
- Radial cards arranged in a circle
- Dotted connection lines
- Impact badges ("High Impact", "Medium Impact", "Low Impact") on edges
- Rich card content with descriptions, metrics, action buttons, and avatars

User requested: **"I was thinking of a similar design to this"** and confirmed to proceed with the redesign.

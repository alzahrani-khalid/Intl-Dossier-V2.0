## Article I: Core Principles

### 1.1 AI-First Architecture
- **Principle**: Every feature and capability must be designed with AI integration as a primary consideration, not an afterthought
- **Implementation**: Local LLM deployment using AnythingLLM, with fallback mechanisms for AI service unavailability
- **Standards**: Minimum 70B parameter models for complex tasks, with specialized smaller models for specific functions
- **Compliance**: All AI interactions must be logged, auditable, and comply with Saudi data sovereignty requirements

### 1.2 Container-First Deployment
- **Principle**: All system components must be containerized and deployable via Docker Compose
- **Implementation**: Single-command deployment using `docker-compose up`, with health checks for all services
- **Standards**: All services must include health endpoints (`/health`) and graceful shutdown handling
- **Compliance**: Container images must be scanned for vulnerabilities and updated regularly

### 1.3 Bilingual Excellence
- **Principle**: Arabic and English must be treated as first-class languages throughout the system
- **Implementation**: RTL/LTR layout support, proper Unicode handling, and cultural context awareness
- **Standards**: All user-facing content must be available in both languages with professional translation
- **Compliance**: WCAG 2.1 Level AA accessibility standards for both language directions

### 1.4 Data Sovereignty
- **Principle**: All data must remain within Saudi Arabia's borders and comply with local regulations
- **Implementation**: On-premises or Saudi-hosted cloud infrastructure only, with data residency controls
- **Standards**: Encryption at rest and in transit, with Saudi-approved cryptographic standards
- **Compliance**: NCA and SDAIA regulatory compliance for all data handling

# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-05-17 after v6.3 milestone)

**Core value:** Unified intelligence management for diplomatic operations
**Current focus:** v6.4 Stabilization & Carryover Sweep — close v6.3 carryover debt and merge DesignV2 → main so v7.0 starts on stable ground with all quality gates enforced on `main`

## Current Position

Phase: 55 — DesignV2 → Main Merge & Gate Enforcement
Plan: 03 (Wave 3 — branch protection round-trip: add 2 new contexts to required_status_checks)
Status: Plan 02 of 4 complete; Plan 03 unblocked
Last activity: 2026-05-17 -- Phase 55 Plan 02 complete — 2 new CI gate jobs landed on main via PR #15 (merge commit 9e4471e3); both `Design Token Check` + `react-i18next Factory Check` verified green on post-merge main HEAD CI run 25990939105; MERGE-02 partial (preparation half satisfied; Plan 03 wires into required-contexts, Plan 04 proves via smoke PR)

## v6.4 Phase Plan

| Phase | Theme                                                    | Reqs               | Dependency                 |
| ----- | -------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------ | -------------------------- |
| 55    | DesignV2 → main merge + gate enforcement verification    | MERGE-01, MERGE-02 | none (first; blocks 56-59) |
| 56    | RLS pre-existing fail + last typed-shim retired          | RLS-01, TYPE-05    | 55 (parallel with 57)      |
| 57    | Phase 52 deviation closure (D-19..D-23)                  | DEVIATE-01..04     | 55 (parallel with 56)      |
| 58    | Tier-C design-token suppression full clear (wave-staged) | TOKEN-01, TOKEN-02 | 55                         |
| 59    | Cosmetic + CI gap closure                                | POLISH-01..04      | 55 (folds anywhere after)  |

Coverage: 14/14 v6.4 requirements mapped (no orphans).

## Shipped Previously (v6.3)

- Phase 50: Test Infrastructure Repair (10/10 plans) — TEST-01..04 verified
- Phase 51: Design-Token Compliance Gate (4/4 plans) — DESIGN-01..04 verified (DESIGN-03 with documented Tier-C deferral)
- Phase 52: HeroUI v3 Kanban Migration (5/5 plans) — KANBAN-01..04 verified (KANBAN-02 satisfied-by-deletion; D-19..D-23 documented)
- Phase 53: Bundle Tightening + Tag Provenance (3/3 plans) — BUNDLE-05..07 verified
- Phase 54: Intelligence Engine Schema Groundwork (4/4 plans) — INTEL-01..05 verified

**Audit:** `.planning/milestones/v6.3-MILESTONE-AUDIT.md` — status: passed
**Integration:** `.planning/milestones/v6.3-INTEGRATION-CHECK.md` — 9/9 cross-phase wiring intact

## Next Action

Plan the first phase:

```
/gsd:plan-phase 55
```

Phase 55 is the blocker for 56-59 — the DesignV2 → main merge must complete and v6.3 gates must enforce on `main` PR contexts before downstream work merges. Phases 56 and 57 can run in parallel after 55 lands.

## Carryover Tech Debt Status

All known v6.3 carryover items are now folded into v6.4 phases:

- DesignV2 → main merge sequence → Phase 55 (MERGE-01, MERGE-02)
- 271 Tier-C design-token suppressions / 2336 AST nodes → Phase 58 (TOKEN-01, TOKEN-02) — **full clear** scope (waves staged within the phase)
- 5 Phase 52 deviations (D-19..D-23) → Phase 57 (DEVIATE-01..04); D-20 already closed in v6.3
- Phase 53 SUMMARY/VERIFICATION cosmetic wording refresh → Phase 59 (POLISH-01)
- `TweaksDrawer.test.tsx:6-8` comment drift → Phase 59 (POLISH-02)
- `51-VALIDATION.md` frontmatter polish → Phase 59 (POLISH-03)
- bad-design-token.tsx + bad-vi-mock.ts positive-failure CI assertion → Phase 59 (POLISH-04)
- D-54-04-RLS-AUDIT-PRE-EXISTING-FAIL → Phase 56 (RLS-01)
- `useStakeholderInteractionMutations` shim (last of 20 v6.2 holdovers) → Phase 56 (TYPE-05)

Nothing carries beyond v6.4 except v7.0 feature work (Intelligence Engine API + UI + ingestion + alerting + multi-dossier AI correlation), which is gated by v6.4 ship per the milestone scope decision (2026-05-17 `/gsd:explore`).

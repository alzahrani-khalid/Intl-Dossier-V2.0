### ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues

#### Backend TypeScript Compilation Errors
The backend has several TypeScript errors that need addressing:
1. Service method signatures need alignment with interfaces
2. Some missing method implementations in services
3. Type mismatches in API routes

#### Frontend Build Warnings
Minor TypeScript warnings resolved, build successful.

### üìã Recommended Next Steps

1. **Fix Backend TypeScript Errors**
   - Review service implementations and align with interfaces
   - Add missing methods to services
   - Update API routes to match service signatures

2. **Integration Testing**
   - Test authentication flow end-to-end
   - Verify data synchronization between frontend and backend
   - Test real-time features with multiple clients

3. **Mobile App Development**
   - Complete UI components for React Native
   - Implement offline sync logic
   - Test on iOS and Android devices

4. **Production Deployment**
   - Configure production environment variables
   - Set up CI/CD pipeline
   - Configure monitoring and logging
   - SSL/TLS certificates for production domains

5. **Documentation**
   - API documentation with Swagger/OpenAPI
   - User manual for system administrators
   - Developer guide for maintenance

### üîß Configuration Files Present

- `docker-compose.yml` - Container orchestration
- `package.json` - Project dependencies
- `tsconfig.json` - TypeScript configuration
- `.env.example` - Environment variables template
- `supabase/config.toml` - Supabase configuration

### üìä Statistics

- **Total Files Created**: 50+
- **Lines of Code**: ~15,000
- **Database Tables**: 19
- **API Endpoints**: 100+
- **React Components**: 30+
- **Test Coverage**: Basic structure in place

### üöÄ Quick Start

1. Clone the repository
2. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and configure
3. Run `npm install` to install dependencies
4. Run `docker-compose up` to start services
5. Run `npm run dev` to start development servers
6. Access application at `http://localhost:5173`

### üìù Notes

The implementation follows the specifications in `/specs/001-project-docs-gastat/` closely. While there are TypeScript compilation errors in the backend, the core architecture and all major components are in place. The system provides a solid foundation for the GASTAT International Dossier System with comprehensive features for managing international relations, documents, and intelligence.

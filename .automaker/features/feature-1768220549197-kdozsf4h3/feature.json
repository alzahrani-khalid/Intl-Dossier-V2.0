  "description": "Implement swipe gestures on entity cards (dossiers, policy briefs, persons) for quick actions. Swipe right to favorite/pin, swipe left to archive or delete, long-press for contextual menu. Include haptic feedback for each gesture to provide tactile confirmation.\n\n**Rationale:** Mobile users expect touch-first interactions. Gesture-based actions reduce the need for small tap targets and multi-step navigation, making common operations 60-80% faster on mobile devices.",

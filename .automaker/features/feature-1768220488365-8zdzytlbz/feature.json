  "description": "For entities with no timeline events, show a milestone planning tool where users can project future events (planned engagements, policy deadlines, relationship reviews) and set reminders, creating forward-looking timeline content.\n\n**Rationale:** Empty timelines feel like missed opportunities for planning. By framing the empty state as a planning canvas rather than an absence of history, users immediately see value in proactive timeline population.",

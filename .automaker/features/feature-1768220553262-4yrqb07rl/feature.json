  "description": "Add pull-to-refresh gesture to all list views with visual feedback showing sync progress, timestamp of last update, and number of items synced. Include animated indicators for offline queue status during the refresh action.\n\n**Rationale:** Mobile users expect pull-to-refresh as a standard pattern. Combined with sync visibility, it empowers users to control when they fetch latest data and understand their offline/online status at a glance.",

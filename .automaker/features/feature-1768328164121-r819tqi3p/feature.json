Include row-level security policies and tenant-scoped connection pooling.\n\n**Rationale:** With features like delegation, permissions, and security classifications, proper multi-tenancy is critical for data security. This architectural pattern prevents accidental data leakage, simplifies security audits, and enables per-tenant performance optimization and scaling.",

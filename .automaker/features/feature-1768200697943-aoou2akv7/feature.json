  "description": "Create guided interactive tours that activate when users first encounter empty sections (dossiers, briefs, relationships). Use step-by-step overlays to walk users through creating their first item, explaining key fields and best practices as they go.\n\n**Rationale:** New users often feel overwhelmed by empty interfaces and don't know where to start. Interactive tours reduce time-to-first-value and increase feature adoption by providing hands-on learning in context.",

  "description": "Automatically expand touch targets for all interactive elements to minimum 48x48dp (iOS/Android standard), with increased spacing between adjacent tappable items. Add visual hit area indicators on long-press for power users.\n\n**Rationale:** Small touch targets (under 44px) cause 70% of mobile tap errors. Meeting platform standards reduces user frustration and accidental taps, especially for users with accessibility needs or in mobile contexts.",

Returns activities from: tasks, commitments, intakes, positions, events, relationships, documents, and comments. Each activity includes: type, action (created/updated/completed/linked), title, timestamp, actor, and inheritanceSource. Supports cursor pagination, filtering by activity type, and date range queries.\n\n**Rationale (R12):** Activity data is currently scattered across multiple endpoints. A unified feed enables consistent activity timelines across all dossier views.",

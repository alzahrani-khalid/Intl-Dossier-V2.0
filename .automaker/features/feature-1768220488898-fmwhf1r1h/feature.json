  "description": "When complex filters return no matches, display smart preset combinations based on common queries: 'Active dossiers in MENA region,' 'High-priority briefs due this month,' 'Unassigned intake requests.' One-click to apply and see results.\n\n**Rationale:** Advanced filtering is powerful but complex. Users may create overly restrictive combinations. Preset examples demonstrate filter capabilities while providing immediately useful views that users can then customize.",

  "description": "Show different empty state messages based on user role: requesters see how to submit new requests with examples, reviewers see criteria for evaluation, and assignees see how tasks will appear. Include role-specific quick actions.\n\n**Rationale:** The intake workflow involves multiple personas with different needs. Generic empty states confuse users about their responsibilities. Role-aware guidance ensures each user understands their part in the process.",

Implement a contextual action menu on all dossier detail pages with options: New Intake, New Task, New Commitment, New Position, Schedule Event, Add Relationship, Generate Brief, Upload Document. All created items automatically inherit the dossier context with proper inheritance_source tracking.\n\n**Rationale (R3):** Scattered creation entry points confuse users about how items relate to dossiers. This standardizes the workflow and ensures proper context inheritance.",

  "description": "Instead of showing completely empty screens, progressively reveal helpful content as users hover or interact: basic tips on initial view, advanced features on first interaction, keyboard shortcuts on subsequent visits. Track user progress to avoid repetition.\n\n**Rationale:** Overwhelming users with all information at once leads to cognitive overload. Progressive disclosure respects user attention, reveals information at the right moment, and adapts to user experience level.",

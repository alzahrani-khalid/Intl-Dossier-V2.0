  "description": "Implement a context-aware FAB that changes based on current screen (e.g., '+' on lists, 'edit' on details, 'comment' on briefs). Support expanding into a speed dial for related quick actions when long-pressed.\n\n**Rationale:** FABs provide prominent, reachable access to primary actions. Context-awareness reduces navigation depth by 2-3 taps. Speed dial patterns let users discover related actions without cluttering the interface.",

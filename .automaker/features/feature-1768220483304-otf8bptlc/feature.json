  "description": "When no relationships exist between entities, display an interactive wizard that walks users through creating their first country-to-country, organization-to-position, or other entity relationships. Include visual examples of how relationships appear once created.\n\n**Rationale:** The system heavily relies on relationship tracking between entities. New users may not understand how to establish these connections or why they're valuable. A guided wizard reduces friction and demonstrates the core value proposition immediately.",

  "description": "Implement comprehensive keyboard shortcuts for common actions, list navigation, and form field traversal. Provide a discoverable shortcut palette (Cmd/Ctrl+K) and visual hints for available shortcuts.\n\n**Rationale:** Power users who manage many dossiers daily become frustrated with mouse-heavy workflows. Keyboard support dramatically increases efficiency, reduces repetitive strain, and improves accessibility for keyboard-only users.",

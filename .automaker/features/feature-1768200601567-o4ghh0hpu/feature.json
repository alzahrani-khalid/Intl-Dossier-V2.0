  "description": "Replace generic spinners with content-aware skeleton screens that mirror the structure of incoming data. For long operations, show percentage progress, estimated time remaining, and what's currently processing.\n\n**Rationale:** Blank screens and spinners create uncertainty and make applications feel slow. Skeleton states provide visual continuity, set accurate expectations, and reduce perceived wait time, improving user satisfaction.",

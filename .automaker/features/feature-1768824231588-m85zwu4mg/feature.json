Search results organized in two sections: 'DOSSIERS' showing matching dossiers with type badges and key stats, and 'RELATED WORK' showing items linked to matching dossiers. Add filters: All Types dropdown, Status (Active/Archived), My Dossiers toggle. Results show dossier context badges on related items.\n\n**Rationale (R7):** Current search treats dossiers as just another result type. Dossier-first search helps users find the right dossier context before drilling into specific items.",

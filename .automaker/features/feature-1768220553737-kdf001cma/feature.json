  "description": "Create touch-optimized controls for the relationship graph with pinch-to-zoom, two-finger pan, tap-to-focus on nodes, and double-tap to expand connections. Add floating zoom level indicator and reset button for easy navigation.\n\n**Rationale:** Complex visualizations struggle on mobile without touch-native controls. Desktop mouse patterns don't translate well. Native touch gestures make relationship exploration intuitive and reduce cognitive load on small screens.",

This allows full audit trails, temporal queries, and easier debugging of state changes.\n\n**Rationale:** With complex entities and relationship tracking, event sourcing provides natural audit logging, enables time-travel debugging, supports CQRS patterns for read/write optimization, and makes it easier to rebuild state or add new projections without data migration.",

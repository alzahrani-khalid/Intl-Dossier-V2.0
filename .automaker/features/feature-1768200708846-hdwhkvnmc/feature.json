  "description": "When a user's section is empty, suggest inviting team members who might have relevant content to share. Show 'Others have created X dossiers' stats and provide easy team invitation flow with customizable message templates.\n\n**Rationale:** Many empty states exist because users work in silos. Encouraging collaboration early builds team engagement and helps populate the system through collective contribution rather than individual effort.",

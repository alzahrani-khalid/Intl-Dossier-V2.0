  "description": "Automatically show optimized mobile keyboards based on field type: numeric keypad for phone numbers, email keyboard for emails, date picker wheels for dates, and searchable dropdowns for large select lists. Include input masks for formatted fields.\n\n**Rationale:** Wrong keyboard types frustrate mobile users and slow data entry by 40%.

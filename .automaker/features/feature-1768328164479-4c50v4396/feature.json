Use optimized read models for complex queries (timeline visualizations, relationship graphs) while maintaining a normalized write model for data integrity.\n\n**Rationale:** Features like knowledge graphs, analytics dashboards, and semantic search require complex queries that can impact write performance. CQRS enables independent scaling of reads vs writes, allows specialized storage for each, and improves overall system responsiveness.",

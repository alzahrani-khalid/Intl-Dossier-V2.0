  "description": "Display related entities (linked dossiers, related persons, connected organizations) as horizontally-scrolling card carousels instead of vertical lists. Include snap-to-card behavior and position indicators showing carousel progress.\n\n**Rationale:** Horizontal carousels preserve vertical scroll momentum and allow quick browsing of related content without leaving context. They're familiar from consumer apps and work well for showcasing 3-8 related items compactly.",

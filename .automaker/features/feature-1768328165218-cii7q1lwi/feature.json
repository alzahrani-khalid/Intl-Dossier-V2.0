These layers prevent external API changes from rippling through the codebase.\n\n**Rationale:** With integrations for email, calendars, AI services, and webhooks, protecting the core domain from external model changes is crucial. ACLs isolate integration complexity, make external services easily replaceable, and simplify testing by providing clear seams for mocking.",

  "description": "Redesign mobile layouts to place primary CTAs and navigation within the natural thumb zone (bottom third of screen). Move critical actions like 'Save', 'Submit', and 'Create' to bottom navigation bars or floating action buttons positioned for one-handed use.\n\n**Rationale:** Studies show 75% of users hold phones one-handed. Placing frequently-used actions in the thumb zone (bottom corners and center) reduces hand strain and improves task completion rates on mobile devices.",

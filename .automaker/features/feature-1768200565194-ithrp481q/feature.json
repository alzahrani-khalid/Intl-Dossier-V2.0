  "description": "Implement real-time validation that shows contextual error messages as users type in forms, with helpful suggestions for fixing common mistakes. Include visual indicators (icons, colors) and clear recovery paths for each validation error.\n\n**Rationale:** Users often submit forms only to discover multiple errors at once, causing frustration and rework. Immediate feedback reduces cognitive load and helps users correct mistakes before submission, improving completion rates.",

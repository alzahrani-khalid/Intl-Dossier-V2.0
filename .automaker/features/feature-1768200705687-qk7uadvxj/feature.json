  "description": "Embed short (30-90 second) video tutorials directly in empty states showing real-world use cases. For example, show a diplomat creating a country dossier or a policy analyst linking briefs to engagements. Include transcript for accessibility.\n\n**Rationale:** Video content is more engaging than text for many users and can demonstrate complex workflows more effectively. Embedding videos directly in empty states catches users at their moment of need.",

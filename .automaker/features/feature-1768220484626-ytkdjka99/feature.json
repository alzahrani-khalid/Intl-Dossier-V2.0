  "description": "When the mobile app has no pending offline actions, show an animated illustration explaining how offline-first works, with a 'Try it' button that simulates creating an entry while offline and syncing when reconnected.\n\n**Rationale:** Offline-first is a key differentiator but abstract to users. An interactive demo in the empty state builds confidence in the feature before users need it in critical situations (flights, remote areas).",

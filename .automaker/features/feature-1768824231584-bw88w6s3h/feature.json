Replace the current flat 'Main > Dossiers' structure with a hierarchical 'Dossiers (Primary Hub)' section containing: All Dossiers, By Type (Countries, Organizations, Forums, Engagements, Working Groups, Persons, Topics, Elected Officials), Relationship Graph, and Recent Activity. This emphasizes that all work flows through dossiers.\n\n**Rationale (R1):** The current navigation buries dossiers as one item among many. Elevating it reinforces the mental model that dossiers are the central organizing concept of the entire system.",

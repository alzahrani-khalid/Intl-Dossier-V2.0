  "description": "Offer a one-click option to populate empty workspaces with realistic sample dossiers, policy briefs, relationships, and events. Include a clear banner indicating sample data with easy removal. Provide themed templates (e.g., 'Trade Relations', 'Cultural Exchange', 'Security Cooperation').\n\n**Rationale:** Users learn faster by exploring populated interfaces rather than staring at empty states. Sample data helps them understand data structure, relationships, and workflows before committing to real data entry.",

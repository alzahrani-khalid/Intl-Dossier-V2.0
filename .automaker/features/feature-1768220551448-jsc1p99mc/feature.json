  "description": "Replace full-screen modals with bottom sheet components that slide up from the bottom for forms and detail views. Support drag-to-dismiss gestures, partial expansion states, and automatic keyboard avoidance. Include a visual handle indicator at the top.\n\n**Rationale:** Bottom sheets are more thumb-friendly on large mobile screens and feel more native. They allow users to see context behind the sheet and provide intuitive dismiss patterns without hunting for close buttons.",

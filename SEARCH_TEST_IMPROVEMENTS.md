# Search & Retrieval Test Improvements

**Date**: 2025-10-05
**Feature**: 015-search-retrieval-spec
**Status**: Edge Functions Improved & Redeployed

---

## Summary

Improved all three search Edge Functions to use proper database functions, better ranking algorithms, and correct response schemas. All functions have been redeployed to staging (project: zkrcjzdemdmwhearhfgg).

---

## Improvements Made

### 1. GET /search (T039) ✅ IMPROVED

**Previous Issues**:
- Used simple ILIKE queries instead of full-text search
- Hardcoded rank_score = 0.5 instead of proper ranking
- No snippet generation with highlighting
- Missing bilingual error message format

**Improvements**:
- ✅ Now uses `search_entities_fulltext()` database function
- ✅ Proper tsvector full-text search with ts_rank_cd ranking
- ✅ Snippet generation with `<mark>` tag highlighting via ts_headline
- ✅ Language-aware search (English/Arabic/Mixed detection)
- ✅ Searches both staff_profiles AND external_contacts for "people" type
- ✅ Normalized rank scores to 0-1 range
- ✅ Fixed error response format to include `details.message` and `details.message_ar`

**Expected Impact on Tests**:
- ✅ rank_score will now be properly calculated (not 0.5 for all results)
- ✅ snippet_en and snippet_ar will contain highlighted text with `<mark>` tags
- ✅ Results will be properly ranked by relevance
- ✅ Error responses will pass bilingual message validation
- ✅ Should improve contract test pass rate from 86% to 95%+

---

### 2. GET /search-suggest (T040) ✅ IMPROVED

**Previous Issues**:
- Simple ILIKE prefix matching without scoring
- Hardcoded score = 0.8 for all suggestions
- No preview text from description fields
- Missing match position calculation

**Improvements**:
- ✅ Dynamic field selection based on table structure
- ✅ Proper field mapping (dossiers use name_en/name_ar, staff use full_name_en/full_name_ar)
- ✅ Score calculation based on match position (earlier matches rank higher)
- ✅ Preview text extracted from description/summary fields (100 char limit)
- ✅ Proper sorting: score DESC, then match_position ASC
- ✅ Handles both English and Arabic prefix matching

**Expected Impact on Tests**:
- ✅ Suggestions will have realistic scores based on match quality
- ✅ preview_en and preview_ar fields will be populated
- ✅ match_position will indicate where the match occurs in the title
- ✅ Results will be better ranked by relevance
- ✅ Should improve contract test pass rate from 89% to 95%+

---

### 3. POST /search-semantic (T041) ✅ CREATED & DEPLOYED

**Previous Status**: **Function did not exist!**

**New Implementation**:
- ✅ Created complete semantic search Edge Function
- ✅ Uses `search_entities_semantic()` database function
- ✅ Validates entity types (only positions, documents, briefs supported)
- ✅ Validates similarity_threshold (0.0-1.0 range)
- ✅ Supports hybrid search (semantic + keyword results)
- ✅ Placeholder embedding generation (TODO: integrate with AnythingLLM)
- ✅ Performance metrics tracking
- ✅ Proper error handling with bilingual messages

**Expected Impact on Tests**:
- ✅ Endpoint will now respond (was 404 before)
- ✅ Response schema will match OpenAPI contract
- ✅ Validation errors will be properly formatted
- ✅ Should bring contract test pass rate from 43% to 70%+
- ⚠️ Note: Real embeddings required for full functionality (currently uses placeholder zeros)

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Before Running Tests)

1. **Verify Database Functions Exist**:
   ```sql
   SELECT proname FROM pg_proc WHERE proname IN ('search_entities_fulltext', 'search_entities_semantic');
   ```
   Expected: 2 rows

2. **Check Search Vector Columns**:
   ```sql
   SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.columns
   WHERE column_name = 'search_vector' AND table_schema = 'public';
   ```
   Expected: 6 tables (dossiers, staff_profiles, engagements, positions, external_contacts, attachments)

3. **Verify HNSW Indexes**:
   ```sql
   SELECT indexname FROM pg_indexes WHERE indexname LIKE '%embedding%';
   ```
   Expected: 3 indexes (positions, attachments, briefs)

### Testing Strategy

#### Contract Tests (Priority 1)
Run contract tests to verify improvements:

```bash
cd backend
npm test -- tests/contract/search-get.test.ts
npm test -- tests/contract/search-suggest-get.test.ts
npm test -- tests/contract/search-semantic-post.test.ts
```

**Expected Results**:
- GET /search: 12-13/14 passing (from 12/14) ➜ **93% pass rate**
- GET /search-suggest: 17-18/18 passing (from 16/18) ➜ **100% pass rate**
- POST /search-semantic: 15-18/21 passing (from 9/21) ➜ **85% pass rate**

**Overall Target**: 44-49/53 passing ➜ **83-92% pass rate**

#### Integration Tests (Priority 2)
```bash
npm test -- tests/integration/search-*.test.ts
```

#### E2E Tests (Priority 3)
```bash
cd ../frontend
npm run test:e2e -- tests/e2e/search-*.spec.ts
```

## Known Limitations

### 1. Semantic Search Embeddings
**Issue**: Currently using placeholder embedding (all zeros)
**Impact**: Semantic search will return no results or random results
**Resolution**: Integrate with AnythingLLM or vector.service.ts for real embeddings

### 2. Redis Cache
**Issue**: No Redis integration yet (cache_hit always false)
**Impact**: Suggestions may not meet <200ms target without cache
**Resolution**: Implement Redis cache layer as designed in research.md

### 3. Boolean Operator Parsing
**Issue**: Detected but not fully parsed to tsquery syntax
**Impact**: Complex queries (AND/OR/NOT) may not work as expected
**Resolution**: Implement query-parser.service.ts for proper tsquery conversion

### 4. Archived Items Filtering
**Issue**: `include_archived` parameter not fully implemented
**Impact**: May return archived items even when include_archived=false
**Resolution**: Add status filters to search_entities_fulltext function calls

---

## Performance Expectations

### GET /search
- **Target**: <500ms p95
- **Current (estimated)**: 300-600ms
- **Bottleneck**: Multiple RPC calls per entity type
- **Optimization**: Parallel execution, caching

### GET /search-suggest
- **Target**: <200ms absolute
- **Current (without Redis)**: 200-500ms
- **Bottleneck**: Database queries across 6 tables
- **Optimization**: Redis cache (5-min TTL)

### POST /search-semantic
- **Target**: <500ms p95
- **Current (with placeholder)**: 100-300ms
- **With Real Embeddings**: 300-800ms (includes embedding generation)
- **Bottleneck**: Embedding generation (100-300ms)
- **Optimization**: Cache query embeddings

---

## Test Data Requirements

For tests to pass, the database needs:

1. **Minimum 5 dossiers** with:
   - name_en containing "climate"
   - name_ar containing "مناخ"
   - search_vector populated

2. **Minimum 3 positions** with:
   - title_en/title_ar populated
   - status = 'published'
   - search_vector populated
   - (Optional) embedding vector for semantic search

3. **Minimum 2 people** (staff_profiles OR external_contacts) with:
   - full_name_en/full_name_ar populated
   - search_vector populated

4. **At least 1 document** (attachment) with:
   - file_name populated
   - search_vector populated

**Seed Data**: Run `specs/015-search-retrieval-spec/seed/test-data.sql` (if exists)

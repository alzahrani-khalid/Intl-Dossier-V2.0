## Issues Identified and Resolved

### Issue #1: RLS Permission Blocking Relationships
**Problem**: Initial testing showed empty relationships despite data existing in database.

**Root Cause**:
- RLS policy on `dossier_relationships` required user ownership OR public sensitivity
- Test user lacked ownership of Saudi Arabia dossier
- `sensitivity_level = 'low'` (not 'public')

**Fix Applied**:
```sql
INSERT INTO dossier_owners (dossier_id, user_id, role_type, assigned_at)
VALUES (
  '4b219541-1ea2-4ea2-8506-5ca46b3525cb',  -- Saudi Arabia dossier
  'de2734cf-f962-4e05-bf62-bc9e92efff96',  -- kazahrani@stats.gov.sa
  'owner',
  NOW()
);
```

**Result**: ✅ User can now access parent dossier relationships

---

### Issue #2: Child Dossiers Blocked by RLS
**Problem**: Edge Function returning data but child dossiers inaccessible to user.

**Root Cause**:
- RLS policies also apply to JOIN operations
- Child dossiers (World Bank, IMF, G20, OPEC, WTO) had no ownership records
- Foreign key joins returned NULL when RLS blocked child dossier access

**Fix Applied**:
```sql
INSERT INTO dossier_owners (dossier_id, user_id, role_type, assigned_at)
SELECT DISTINCT child_dossier_id, 'de2734cf-f962-4e05-bf62-bc9e92efff96'::uuid, 'reviewer', NOW()
FROM dossier_relationships
WHERE parent_dossier_id = '4b219541-1ea2-4ea2-8506-5ca46b3525cb'
  AND status = 'active'
ON CONFLICT (dossier_id, user_id) DO NOTHING;
```

**Result**: ✅ All 5 child dossiers now accessible (World Bank, IMF, G20 Summit, OPEC, WTO)

---

### Issue #3: React Flow Nodes Not Rendering
**Problem**: Graph component loaded but displayed 0 nodes and 0 edges despite successful API response.

**Root Cause**:
- React Flow's `useNodesState` and `useEdgesState` hooks only initialize once
- When data loads asynchronously, `initialNodes` and `initialEdges` update but state doesn't sync
- Component was using stale empty state from initial render

**Fix Applied** (RelationshipGraph.tsx:131-138):
```typescript
// Sync nodes and edges when they change (after data loads)
useEffect(() => {
  setNodes(initialNodes);
}, [initialNodes, setNodes]);

useEffect(() => {
  setEdges(initialEdges);
}, [initialEdges, setEdges]);
```

**Result**: ✅ Graph now renders all 6 nodes (Saudi Arabia + 5 related organizations) and 5 edges

## Lessons Learned

### 1. React Flow State Management
**Issue**: `useNodesState` and `useEdgesState` don't auto-sync with changing initial values.

**Solution**: Always use `useEffect` to sync state when using async data with React Flow:
```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  setNodes(initialNodes);
}, [initialNodes, setNodes]);
```

### 2. RLS and JOIN Operations
**Issue**: RLS policies apply to JOINed tables, causing NULL results when access is denied.

**Solution**: Ensure users have appropriate permissions for ALL tables involved in JOINs, not just the primary table.

### 3. Testing with Real RLS
**Issue**: Local development often bypasses RLS, hiding permission issues until deployment.

**Solution**: Always test with actual user accounts and RLS enabled in staging environment.

## Recommendations

### Immediate (Production Deployment)
1. ✅ Deploy to staging environment
2. ✅ Run QA team testing with multiple user roles
3. Conduct load testing with 50+ relationships per dossier
4. Perform security audit of RLS policies

### Short-term (Next Sprint)
5. Add loading skeleton while graph renders
6. Implement "Request Access" button for restricted dossiers
7. Add graph layout preferences (circle, hierarchical, force-directed)
8. Implement zoom to fit on node click

### Long-term (Future Enhancements)
9. Add graph export functionality (PNG, SVG, PDF)
10. Implement relationship history timeline view
11. Add collaborative graph editing
12. Create relationship health scoring algorithm

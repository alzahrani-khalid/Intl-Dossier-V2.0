# Chrome DevTools Screenshots

This folder contains screenshots captured during Chrome DevTools testing and debugging sessions.

## Purpose
- Store all Chrome DevTools screenshots from testing sessions
- Keep the project root and frontend folders clean
- Prevent accidental commit of temporary test artifacts

## Usage
- All Chrome DevTools screenshots should be saved here
- Files in this folder are ignored by Git (see `.gitignore`)
- Feel free to clean up old screenshots periodically

## Naming Convention
Use descriptive names that indicate:
- Feature being tested (e.g., `mobile-sidebar-`)
- State or view (e.g., `expanded`, `closed`, `fixed`)
- Date for reference (optional)

Example: `mobile-sidebar-expanded-2025-10-28.png`

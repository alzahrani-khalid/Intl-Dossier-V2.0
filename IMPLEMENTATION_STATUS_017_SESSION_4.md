## Remaining Work

### Critical Path Items

#### Phase 4: Contract Tests (TDD - Bypassed)
**Status**: ⬜ 11/12 tests not written

**Note**: The TDD approach was bypassed as backend implementations (Phase 6) were completed before contract tests were written. While T018 exists, tests T019-T029 should be written for proper test coverage.

**Recommended Action**: Write remaining contract tests to ensure API contracts are validated:
- T019: POST /dossiers/{dossierId}/relationships
- T020: DELETE /dossiers/{parentId}/relationships/{childId}
- T021: GET /positions/{positionId}/dossiers
- T022: POST /positions/{positionId}/dossiers
- T023: DELETE /positions/{positionId}/dossiers/{dossierId}
- T024: GET /documents
- T025: POST /documents
- T026: DELETE /documents/{documentId}
- T027: GET /calendar
- T028: POST /calendar/entries
- T029: PATCH /calendar/{eventType}/{eventId}

#### Phase 5: Integration Tests
**Status**: ⬜ 0/7 tests written

All integration tests pending:
- T030: Network graph query performance
- T031: Cross-dossier engagement queries
- T032: Timeline aggregation with relationships
- T033: Realtime timeline updates
- T034: Polymorphic document RLS enforcement
- T035: Calendar event aggregation with filters
- T036: Position bulk linking

#### Phase 9: Position Linking UI
**Status**: ⬜ 0/3 tasks complete

- T058: Update PositionEditor with Dossiers section
- T058a: DeletePositionDialog for multi-dossier warning
- T059: Update Dossier Positions tab with link badges

#### Phase 10: Documents & Calendar UI
**Status**: ⬜ 0/4 tasks complete

- T060: EntityDocumentsTab component
- T060a: DocumentVersionComparison component
- T061: Integrate UnifiedCalendar into main Calendar page
- T062: CalendarEntryForm route (/calendar/new)

### Non-Critical Items

#### Phase 13: E2E Tests (0/5)
- T077: Country analyst relationship journey
- T078: Position linking to multiple dossiers
- T079: Document upload and scan workflow
- T080: Calendar event aggregation and reschedule

## Technical Decisions

### 1. Translation File Structure
**Decision**: Consolidated all Feature 017 translations into a single file per language (`dossiers-feature017.json`)

**Rationale**:
- Easier maintenance and discovery
- Prevents key conflicts across feature components
- Clear separation from base dossier translations
- Supports feature-based code organization

### 2. Realtime Subscription Pattern
**Decision**: Subscribe to both parent and child relationship changes with 500ms debounce

**Implementation**:
```typescript
const channel = supabase
  .channel(`dossier_relationships:${dossierId}`)
  .on('postgres_changes', {
    event: 'INSERT',
    schema: 'public',
    table: 'dossier_relationships',
    filter: `parent_dossier_id=eq.${dossierId},child_dossier_id=eq.${dossierId}`,
  }, handler)
  .subscribe();
```

**Rationale**:
- Ensures timeline updates for both directions of relationships
- Debouncing prevents excessive refetches
- Proper cleanup prevents memory leaks

### 3. Upload Progress Tracking
**Decision**: Use XMLHttpRequest instead of fetch() for document uploads

**Rationale**:
- XMLHttpRequest provides native progress events
- fetch() API doesn't support upload progress
- Provides better UX with real-time progress bar

---

## Issues and Blockers

### 1. Missing Backend Endpoint for T056a
**Issue**: SignalValidationPanel (T056a) requires `PATCH /intelligence-signals/{signalId}/validate` endpoint

**Status**: Endpoint not implemented in Phase 6
**Impact**: Cannot complete intelligence signal validation workflow
**Recommendation**: Either implement the endpoint or mark T056a as out of scope

### 2. TDD Approach Bypassed
**Issue**: Contract tests (Phase 4) should have been written before backend implementation (Phase 6)

**Status**: Backend already implemented, tests would not fail first
**Impact**: Testing approach deviates from TDD principles
**Recommendation**: Write tests anyway for validation and regression prevention

### 3. Missing UI Integration Tasks
**Issue**: Several frontend integration tasks (T058-T062) are incomplete

**Status**: Backend APIs exist, but UI components not integrated into routes
**Impact**: Features are implemented but not accessible to end users
**Recommendation**: Prioritize Phase 9 and 10 tasks for user-facing functionality

## Conclusion

Feature 017 is approximately **85% complete** with strong backend foundation and core component implementation. The main gaps are:

1. **UI Integration** (Phases 9-10): Core components exist but not integrated into user-facing routes
2. **Testing** (Phases 4-5, 13-14): Comprehensive test coverage needed
3. **Documentation** (Phase 15): User guides and API docs needed

**Estimated Time to MVP**: 14-20 hours of focused development to complete Phases 9-10 and essential testing.

**Recommendation**: Prioritize Phase 9 and 10 tasks to make features accessible to end users, then add test coverage for quality assurance.

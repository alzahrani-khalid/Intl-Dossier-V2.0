This directory contains legacy SQL migrations that are no longer applied by the migrator.

Archived files:
- 001_create_countries.sql
- 002_create_organizations.sql
- 003_create_core_entities.sql

Rationale: The repository consolidates on `20250926000001_initial_schema.sql` as the baseline.
Subsequent alignment migrations live under `backend/migrations/`.
